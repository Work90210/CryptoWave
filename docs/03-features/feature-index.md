# CryptoWave Features Documentation

This document outlines the implemented features of the CryptoWave application, detailing their capabilities, dependencies, and integration points.

## 1. Core Features Overview

CryptoWave is a mobile application designed to provide users with real-time cryptocurrency market data and related functionalities. Its core features revolve around displaying cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and potentially facilitating user interaction with this data. The application employs a modular, feature-based architecture, allowing for organized development and maintainability.

## 2. Feature Categories and Groups

Based on the project structure and common mobile application patterns, the features can be broadly categorized as follows:

*   **Market Data Display:** Features related to fetching, processing, and presenting cryptocurrency market information.
*   **User Interface & Navigation:** Features concerning the application's visual presentation, user interaction, and navigation flow.
*   **Configuration & Settings:** Features that allow users to customize their application experience.
*   **Error Handling & Feedback:** Features that manage and communicate errors or application states to the user.

## 3. Feature Descriptions and Capabilities

While a deep dive into every specific implementation detail requires a more granular code analysis, the following features are inferable from the provided file structure and common mobile development practices:

*   **Cryptocurrency Listing:**
    *   **Description:** Displays a list of various cryptocurrencies.
    *   **Capabilities:** Likely fetches and presents cryptocurrency names, symbols, current prices, and potentially price changes (24h, 7d).
*   **Real-time Price Updates:**
    *   **Description:** Provides up-to-date pricing information for cryptocurrencies.
    *   **Capabilities:** Implies an integration with a market data API to receive and display live price feeds.
*   **Basic Navigation:**
    *   **Description:** Allows users to move between different sections of the application.
    *   **Capabilities:** Suggests the presence of navigation components (e.g., bottom navigation, app bars) to access various features.
*   **Error Display:**
    *   **Description:** Informs the user when an error occurs.
    *   **Capabilities:** The presence of `assets/lottie/error.json` suggests a visual component for displaying error states, likely integrated into a UI element.
*   **Theming (Dark Mode):**
    *   **Description:** Supports a dark mode interface.
    *   **Capabilities:** Indicated by `android/app/src/main/res/values-night/styles.xml`, this feature allows users to switch to a darker color scheme for the UI.
*   **Application Launch Screen:**
    *   **Description:** Displays a background during application startup.
    *   **Capabilities:** The presence of `launch_background.xml` files in `drawable-v21` and `drawable` directories indicates the implementation of a splash screen or launch background.

## 4. Feature Dependencies and Relationships

*   **Market Data Display** features (e.g., Cryptocurrency Listing, Real-time Price Updates) are dependent on external APIs for data.
*   **User Interface & Navigation** features are foundational and support the presentation and accessibility of all other features.
*   **Error Display** is a cross-cutting concern that can be triggered by failures in any feature that interacts with external services or performs complex operations.
*   **Theming** is a UI-level feature that affects the visual presentation of all other UI-related features.

## 5. Feature Configuration Options

*   **`android/gradle.properties` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:** These files likely contain build-time configurations, such as Gradle version, SDK versions, and potentially API keys or endpoint URLs for data fetching. Specific configuration options are not detailed without further analysis of their content.
*   **`analysis_options.yaml` and `devtools_options.yaml`:** These files are related to code analysis and linting, not user-facing application configuration.

## 6. Feature Flags and Toggles

No explicit feature flags or toggles are identifiable from the provided file structure. This suggests that features are either always enabled or managed through build configurations rather than runtime toggles.

## 7. Feature Roadmap and Future Plans

The provided file structure does not contain information regarding a feature roadmap or future plans.

## 8. Feature Usage Examples

*   **Viewing Cryptocurrency Prices:** A user opens the app, sees a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices, and can observe price changes over time.
*   **Switching to Dark Mode:** A user navigates to settings (if implemented) and selects a dark theme option, causing the application's UI to adopt a darker color palette.
*   **Encountering an Error:** If the application fails to fetch market data, a visual indicator (potentially using `error.json`) is displayed to the user, informing them of the issue.

## 9. Feature Limitations and Constraints

*   **Data Source Dependency:** The accuracy and availability of market data are entirely dependent on the external APIs integrated by the application.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The presence of `android/` directory indicates an Android-specific implementation. Features may differ or not be present on other platforms.
*   **Limited Functionality:** Based on the provided files, the application appears to focus on data display rather than transactional features (e.g., trading, portfolio management).

## 10. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Market Data API Integration:** The core market data features (listing, real-time updates) integrate with external APIs. The results of these integrations are then consumed by the UI components for display.
*   **UI Component Integration:** Various UI components (e.g., lists, text views, image views) are integrated to present the fetched market data and user interface elements.
*   **Error Handling Integration:** The error handling mechanism (potentially using `error.json`) is integrated across features that might encounter operational failures, providing a consistent user feedback loop.
*   **Theming Integration:** The dark mode feature integrates with the UI rendering system to apply theme-specific styles to all visual elements.
