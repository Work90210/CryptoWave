    *   **Capabilities:** Leverages iOS SDK and platform-specific features.
    *   **Implementation:** Code resides within the `ios/` directory, with `AppDelegate.swift` handling application lifecycle events. Asset management for icons and launch images is present in `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/`.

## 4. Feature Dependencies and Relationships

*   **Market Data** is a foundational dependency for **Portfolio Management**, as accurate real-time prices are required for calculating portfolio value and profit/loss.
*   **News and Updates** is an independent feature that aggregates external information.
*   **User Interface** elements are used across all features to present data and facilitate user interaction.
*   **Platform Integration** (Android and iOS) dictates how the core features are delivered to users on their respective devices.

## 5. Feature Configuration Options

Based on the provided file structure, specific configuration options for features are not explicitly detailed. However, typical configurations would include:

*   **API Endpoints:** URLs for fetching market data and news.
*   **Refresh Intervals:** How frequently market data and news are updated.
*   **Currency Display:** Preferred fiat currency for displaying values.
*   **Theme Selection:** User choice between light and dark modes.

These configurations are likely managed within the application's code or through configuration files not explicitly listed in the provided structure.

## 6. Feature Flags and Toggles

No explicit feature flags or toggles are identifiable from the provided file list. The application appears to present all core features as consistently available.

## 7. Feature Roadmap and Future Plans

The provided file structure does not contain documentation for a feature roadmap or future plans.

## 8. Feature Usage Examples

*   **Viewing Real-time Prices:** Upon launching the application, the user sees a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices and percentage changes.
*   **Tracking a Portfolio:** A user navigates to the portfolio section, adds "Bitcoin" with a purchase price of $50,000 and a quantity of 0.5. The application then displays the current value of this holding and any unrealized profit or loss.
*   **Reading News:** The user accesses the news section to view recent articles about market trends or specific cryptocurrency developments.

## 9. Feature Limitations and Constraints

*   **Data Source Dependency:** The accuracy and availability of market data and news are dependent on external API providers.

*   **No Trading Functionality:** The current features focus on data display and tracking, not on executing trades.

## 10. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Market Data** is integrated into the **Portfolio Management** feature to provide real-time valuation of assets.
*   The **User Interface** is the primary integration point for all features, presenting data and user interactions consistently across the application.
*   Platform-specific code (`android/`, `ios/`) integrates the core application logic with the underlying operating system's capabilities.
