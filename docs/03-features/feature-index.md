*   **Configuration & Settings:** Features that allow users to customize their application experience.
*   **Error Handling & Feedback:** Features that manage and communicate errors or application states to the user.

## 3. Feature Descriptions and Capabilities

While a deep dive into every specific implementation detail requires a more granular code analysis, the following features are inferable from the provided file structure and common mobile development practices:

*   **Cryptocurrency Listing:**
    *   **Description:** Displays a list of various cryptocurrencies.
    *   **Capabilities:** Shows cryptocurrency names, symbols, current prices, and potentially price changes (24h).
*   **Real-time Price Updates:**
    *   **Description:** Fetches and displays up-to-date pricing information for cryptocurrencies.
    *   **Capabilities:** Provides near real-time price data, crucial for market tracking.
*   **Basic Navigation:**
    *   **Description:** Enables users to move between different sections or views within the application.
    *   **Capabilities:** Likely includes navigation between a main market list and detail views for individual cryptocurrencies.
*   **Application Launch Screen:**
    *   **Description:** Displays a splash screen or launch background during application startup.
    *   **Capabilities:** Provides visual feedback during the loading process. (Referenced by `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-v21/launch_background.xml` and `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml`).
*   **Theming (Dark Mode Support):**
    *   **Description:** Supports different visual themes, including a dark mode.
    *   **Capabilities:** Allows users to switch between light and dark interfaces for better viewing comfort. (Referenced by `android/app/src/main/res/values-night/styles.xml` and `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`).
*   **Error Display:**
    *   **Description:** Shows error messages or states to the user.
    *   **Capabilities:** Utilizes a Lottie animation for error presentation, indicating a visually engaging error feedback mechanism. (Referenced by `assets/lottie/error.json`).
*   **Android Manifest Configuration:**
    *   **Description:** Defines essential application components, permissions, and features for Android.
    *   **Capabilities:** Configures the application's behavior and integration with the Android operating system. (Referenced by `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`, `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml`).
*   **Gradle Build Configuration:**
    *   **Description:** Manages project dependencies, build settings, and versioning for Android.
    *   **Capabilities:** Controls the build process and project configuration. (Referenced by `android/gradle.properties`, `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`, `android/settings.gradle.kts`).
*   **Code Analysis and Linting:**
    *   **Description:** Configures static analysis tools to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
    *   **Capabilities:** Enforces coding conventions and identifies potential issues early in the development cycle. (Referenced by `analysis_options.yaml`, `devtools_options.yaml`).

## 4. Feature Dependencies and Relationships

*   **Market Data Display** features (e.g., Cryptocurrency Listing, Real-time Price Updates) are dependent on external data sources or APIs that are not explicitly detailed in the provided file structure.
*   **User Interface & Navigation** features are foundational and support the display and interaction with market data.
*   **Theming** features are independent but enhance the user experience of all UI-related features.
*   **Error Display** is a cross-cutting concern that can be triggered by failures in data fetching or other operations.
*   **Android Manifest Configuration** and **Gradle Build Configuration** are essential for the application's build and runtime environment on Android.
*   **Code Analysis and Linting** configurations are development-time features that do not directly impact runtime functionality but ensure code quality.

## 5. Feature Configuration Options

*   **Theming:** The application supports switching between light and dark themes, as indicated by the presence of `styles.xml` and `values-night/styles.xml`. The specific mechanism for toggling themes (e.g., a user-facing setting) is not detailed in the provided files.
*   **Build Configurations:** `gradle.properties` and `settings.gradle.kts` likely contain configuration options related to build versions, dependencies, and project settings.

## 6. Feature Flags and Toggles

No explicit feature flags or toggles are identifiable from the provided file structure. The implementation suggests a direct rollout of core features.

## 7. Feature Roadmap and Future Plans

The provided file structure does not contain information regarding a feature roadmap or future development plans. The `docs/00-meta/` directory contains documentation-related files, but not feature roadmaps.

## 8. Feature Usage Examples

*   **Viewing Cryptocurrency Prices:** Upon launching the application, users will see a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices. Tapping on a cryptocurrency (if implemented) would likely navigate to a detail screen showing more information.
*   **Switching Themes:** Users can potentially switch between a light and dark theme via an application setting, altering the visual appearance of the UI elements.
*   **Handling Errors:** If an error occurs during data fetching or processing, the application will display an error message, possibly accompanied by the `error.json` Lottie animation.

## 9. Feature Limitations and Constraints

*   **Data Source Dependency:** The accuracy and availability of cryptocurrency data are entirely dependent on the external APIs or data sources the application integrates with.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The presence of Android-specific configuration files (`AndroidManifest.xml`, `gradle.*`) indicates that the current implementation is primarily for the Android platform. Cross-platform capabilities (e.g., iOS) would require separate implementations or a cross-platform framework not evident here.
*   **Limited Functionality:** Based on the provided files, the application appears to focus on data display rather than transactional features like trading or wallet management.

## 10. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Market Data Display** features are integrated with the **Application Launch Screen** to ensure data is ready before the main content is fully displayed.
*   **Error Handling** is integrated with all features that involve data fetching or processing, providing a consistent way to inform the user of issues.
*   **Theming** is integrated with the **User Interface & Navigation** features to alter the visual presentation of all screens and components.
*   **Android Manifest Configuration** and **Gradle Build Configuration** are fundamental integration points for the entire Android application, enabling its execution and interaction with the operating system.
