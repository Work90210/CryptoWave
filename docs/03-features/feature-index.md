# CryptoWave Features Documentation

This document outlines the implemented features of the CryptoWave application, detailing their capabilities, dependencies, and integration points.

## 1. Core Features Overview

CryptoWave is a mobile application designed to provide users with real-time cryptocurrency market data and related functionalities. Its core features revolve around displaying cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and potentially facilitating user interaction with this data. The application employs a modular, feature-based architecture, allowing for organized development and maintainability.

## 2. Feature Categories and Groups

Based on the project structure and common mobile application patterns, the features can be broadly categorized as follows:

*   **Market Data Display:** Features related to fetching, processing, and presenting cryptocurrency market information.
*   **User Interface & Navigation:** Features concerning the application's visual presentation, user interaction, and navigation flow.
*   **Configuration & Settings:** Features that allow users to customize their application experience.
*   **Error Handling & Feedback:** Features that manage and communicate errors or application states to the user.

## 3. Feature Descriptions and Capabilities

While a deep dive into specific business logic is not possible without executing the code, the file structure suggests the following implemented features:

*   **Market Data Fetching and Display:**
    *   **Capability:** The application is expected to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices and market data from external APIs. This data is likely displayed in a structured format, possibly including lists of cryptocurrencies, their current prices, 24-hour changes, and market capitalization.
    *   **Evidence:** The presence of `analysis_options.yaml` and `devtools_options.yaml` suggests a focus on code quality and analysis, which is crucial for data-intensive applications. The Kotlin files within `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/cryptowave/` are the primary location for application logic, including data fetching and UI rendering.

*   **User Interface Rendering:**
    *   **Capability:** The application renders a user interface for displaying market data and navigating between different sections. This includes handling different screen states and providing visual feedback.
    *   **Evidence:** The presence of XML files in `android/app/src/main/res/` (e.g., `styles.xml`, `launch_background.xml`) indicates the implementation of UI elements, styling, and potentially splash screen functionality.

*   **Error Handling and Display:**
    *   **Capability:** The application includes mechanisms to handle and display errors to the user.
    *   **Evidence:** The `assets/lottie/error.json` file suggests the use of Lottie animations for visually communicating errors or error states within the UI.

*   **Application Configuration:**
    *   **Capability:** The application supports basic configuration settings.
    *   **Evidence:** `android/gradle.properties` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` are standard Android build configuration files, indicating the presence of project-level settings and build configurations.

*   **Platform-Specific Manifests:**
    *   **Capability:** The application defines platform-specific configurations and permissions for Android.
    *   **Evidence:** Multiple `AndroidManifest.xml` files (e.g., `debug`, `main`, `profile`) indicate that the application is built for Android and has distinct configurations for different build types.

## 4. Feature Dependencies and Relationships

The modular architecture implies that features are designed to be independent but may have dependencies on shared modules or services.

*   **Market Data Display** features likely depend on a **Data Fetching Service** (not explicitly detailed in the provided file list but implied by the need for real-time data).
*   **User Interface Rendering** features depend on the **Market Data Display** features to present information and on **Error Handling** features to display appropriate feedback.
*   **Configuration** features may influence the behavior of **Market Data Display** (e.g., preferred currency) and **User Interface Rendering** (e.g., theme settings).

## 5. Feature Configuration Options

Specific user-facing configuration options are not directly evident from the file names alone. However, general configuration is managed through:

*   **Build Configuration:** `android/gradle.properties` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` manage build-time configurations.
*   **Resource Files:** `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml` and `android/app/src/main/res/values-night/styles.xml` suggest theming capabilities (e.g., light/dark mode).

## 6. Feature Flags and Toggles

There is no explicit indication of feature flags or toggles within the provided file structure. This functionality would typically be implemented within the Kotlin code for dynamic feature enabling/disabling.

## 7. Feature Roadmap and Future Plans

The provided file structure does not contain information regarding a feature roadmap or future plans. This information would typically reside in separate documentation files or project management tools.

## 8. Feature Usage Examples

*   **Viewing Cryptocurrency Prices:** A user would launch the application, and the main screen would display a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices and 24-hour percentage changes.
*   **Handling Network Errors:** If the application fails to fetch data, a user-friendly error message, potentially accompanied by an animation from `assets/lottie/error.json`, would be displayed.

## 9. Feature Limitations and Constraints

*   **Platform Specificity:** The presence of Android-specific manifest files and resource directories indicates that the current implementation is primarily for the Android platform.
*   **Data Source Dependency:** The accuracy and availability of market data are dependent on the external APIs the application integrates with.
*   **UI Complexity:** Without seeing the UI code, the complexity and interactivity of the user interface are not fully ascertainable.

## 10. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Market Data Display <-> User Interface Rendering:** Market data fetched and processed is rendered by the UI components.
*   **Market Data Display <-> Error Handling:** If data fetching fails, the error handling mechanism is invoked to inform the user.
*   **User Interface Rendering <-> Configuration:** UI elements and themes can be customized based on application configuration settings.
