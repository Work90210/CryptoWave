# CryptoWave Features Documentation

This document outlines the implemented features of the CryptoWave application, detailing their capabilities, dependencies, and integration points.

## 1. Core Features Overview

CryptoWave is a mobile application designed to provide users with real-time cryptocurrency market data and related functionalities. Its core features revolve around displaying cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and potentially facilitating user interaction with this data. The application employs a modular, feature-based architecture, allowing for organized development and maintainability.

## 2. Feature Categories and Groups

Based on the project structure and common mobile application patterns, the features can be broadly categorized as follows:

*   **Market Data Display:** Features related to fetching, processing, and presenting cryptocurrency market information.
*   **User Interface & Navigation:** Features concerning the application's visual presentation, user interaction, and navigation flow.
*   **Configuration & Settings:** Features that allow users to customize their application experience.
*   **Error Handling & Feedback:** Features that manage and communicate errors or application states to the user.

## 3. Feature Descriptions and Capabilities

While a deep dive into every specific implementation detail requires a more granular code analysis, the following features are inferable from the provided file structure and common mobile development practices:

*   **Cryptocurrency Listing:**
    *   **Description:** Displays a list of various cryptocurrencies.
    *   **Capabilities:** Likely fetches and presents cryptocurrency names, symbols, current prices, and potentially price changes (24h, 7d).
*   **Real-time Price Updates:**
    *   **Description:** Provides up-to-date pricing information for listed cryptocurrencies.
    *   **Capabilities:** Implies an integration with a cryptocurrency data API to receive and display live price feeds.
*   **Basic Navigation:**
    *   **Description:** Allows users to move between different sections or views within the application.
    *   **Capabilities:** Likely includes navigation between a main cryptocurrency list and detail views (though detail views are not explicitly indicated by file names).
*   **Launch Screen/Splash Screen:**
    *   **Description:** Displays a visual element during application startup.
    *   **Capabilities:** Utilizes `launch_background.xml` files for defining the visual appearance of the initial loading screen.
*   **Theming (Dark Mode Support):**
    *   **Description:** Supports different visual themes, including a dark mode.
    *   **Capabilities:** Indicated by `styles.xml` and `values-night/styles.xml`, suggesting the application can adapt its UI colors based on system or user preferences.
*   **Error Display:**
    *   **Description:** Presents error messages or states to the user.
    *   **Capabilities:** The presence of `error.json` in `assets/lottie/` suggests the use of Lottie animations for visually communicating errors.
*   **Android Manifest Configuration:**
    *   **Description:** Defines essential application components, permissions, and features for Android.
    *   **Capabilities:** `AndroidManifest.xml` files (in `debug`, `main`, and `profile` directories) configure the Android application's behavior, including activities, services, and permissions.
*   **Gradle Build Configuration:**
    *   **Description:** Manages project dependencies, build settings, and project configuration for Android.
    *   **Capabilities:** `gradle.properties` and `settings.gradle.kts` files control the Android build process, including versioning and module inclusion.

## 4. Feature Dependencies and Relationships

*   **Market Data Display** features (e.g., Cryptocurrency Listing, Real-time Price Updates) are dependent on external data sources (APIs) and the underlying network communication mechanisms.
*   **User Interface & Navigation** features are foundational, enabling the presentation and interaction with all other features.
*   **Error Display** features are dependent on the error detection and reporting mechanisms within other features.
*   **Theming** features are integrated with the UI rendering components to dynamically adjust visual styles.

## 5. Feature Configuration Options

*   **`gradle.properties`:** This file likely contains configuration properties related to the Android build process, such as `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, and potentially API keys or build-specific settings.
*   **`analysis_options.yaml` / `devtools_options.yaml`:** These files are used to configure static analysis tools (like Dart analyzer or linter) and development tools, influencing code quality and development practices.

## 6. Feature Flags and Toggles

No explicit feature flags or toggles are directly identifiable from the provided file structure. However, the presence of separate `AndroidManifest.xml` files for `debug` and `profile` build types suggests that certain features or configurations might be enabled or disabled based on the build variant.

## 7. Feature Roadmap and Future Plans

The provided file structure does not contain explicit documentation for a feature roadmap or future plans. However, the modular architecture suggests that new features can be added incrementally.

## 8. Feature Usage Examples

*   **Viewing Cryptocurrency Prices:** Users would open the application to see a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices.
*   **Experiencing Dark Mode:** If the user's device is in dark mode, the application's UI elements (backgrounds, text colors) would adapt accordingly.
*   **Observing Error States:** If a network request fails, the user might see a Lottie animation indicating an error, as suggested by `assets/lottie/error.json`.

## 9. Feature Limitations and Constraints

*   **Data Source Dependency:** The accuracy and availability of cryptocurrency data are entirely dependent on the external APIs integrated by the application.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The presence of Android-specific configuration files (`AndroidManifest.xml`, `gradle.properties`) indicates that the current implementation is focused on the Android platform. Features related to iOS or cross-platform compatibility are not evident from this analysis.
*   **Limited UI Elements:** The provided file list does not explicitly show UI components for complex interactions like trading, portfolio management, or detailed charting, suggesting these features are not implemented or are part of a deeper, unlisted module.

## 10. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Market Data Display** features integrate with the **User Interface & Navigation** to present data to the user.
*   **Error Handling** features integrate with all other features that might produce errors, providing a consistent feedback mechanism.
*   **Theming** features integrate with the UI rendering system to apply visual styles across the application.
*   **Android Manifest Configuration** serves as a central integration point for all Android-specific components and permissions required by various features.
