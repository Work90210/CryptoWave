# CryptoWave API Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the CryptoWave API, detailing its functionalities, endpoints, and error handling mechanisms.

## 1. API Overview

CryptoWave is a Flutter application that leverages the CoinGecko API to provide real-time cryptocurrency market data, price charts, and detailed coin information. The application's core functionality relies on fetching and processing data from the CoinGecko API. The application's data fetching and management are handled through a repository pattern, abstracting direct API interactions.

## 2. Authentication

Authentication is not explicitly handled or documented within the provided code snippets. Interactions with the CoinGecko API are assumed to be unauthenticated, relying on the API's public access.

## 3. Endpoint/Function Reference

The primary interaction with external data is managed through repositories that abstract API calls. The `lib/repositories` directory contains specific repository classes for different data interactions.

### `lib/repositories/coin_repository.dart`

This repository is responsible for fetching cryptocurrency data.

### `ExceptionHandler.enhanceException`

This static method within the `ExceptionHandler` class is responsible for transforming base API exceptions into domain-specific exceptions with enhanced context.

**Parameters:**

*   `error`: The original exception object.
*   `contextMessage`: A string providing additional context.

## 4. Request/Response Examples

TODO: Provide examples for API requests and responses.

## 5. Error Handling

The `ExceptionHandler` class is responsible for processing and standardizing API exceptions. It transforms base API exceptions into domain-specific exceptions with enhanced context.

## 6. Rate Limiting

TODO: Document rate limiting policies if applicable.

## 7. SDK/Client Usage Examples

TODO: Provide examples for SDK or client usage.

## 8. Testing Instructions

TODO: Provide instructions for testing the API.
