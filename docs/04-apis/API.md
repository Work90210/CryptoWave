## 1. API Overview

The CryptoWave API provides access to cryptocurrency market data and trading functionalities. It is a RESTful API designed for developers to integrate cryptocurrency services into their applications.

The API documentation is structured across several files to provide a comprehensive understanding of its features and usage.

*   `docs/04-apis/api-overview.md`: Provides a general overview of the API.
*   `docs/04-apis/api.md`: Details the core aspects of the API.
*   `docs/04-apis/rest-api/endpoints/README.md`: Lists and describes available API endpoints.
*   `docs/04-apis/rest-api/openapi.yaml`: Defines the API's structure using the OpenAPI specification.

## 2. Authentication

TODO: Authentication details are not provided in the CONTEXT.

## 3. Endpoint Reference

The CryptoWave API exposes various endpoints for interacting with cryptocurrency data. The OpenAPI specification (`docs/04-apis/rest-api/openapi.yaml`) provides a detailed schema for all available endpoints, including their paths, methods, parameters, and responses.

For a human-readable list and description of endpoints, refer to `docs/04-apis/rest-api/endpoints/README.md`.

## 4. Request/Response Examples

The repository includes examples to illustrate how to make requests to the API and interpret the responses.

*   `docs/04-apis/rest-api/request-examples.md`: Contains examples of API requests.
*   `docs/04-apis/rest-api/response-examples.md`: Contains examples of API responses.

## 5. Error Handling

The API employs a consistent error handling strategy to inform clients about issues encountered during request processing.

*   `docs/04-apis/error-handling.md`: Details the error codes, messages, and structures returned by the API.
*   `lib/network/exception_handler.dart`: This file likely contains the implementation logic for handling network-related exceptions within the application.

The API also defines specific status codes for various scenarios, as documented in `docs/04-apis/rest-api/status-codes.md`.

## 6. Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and stability, the API implements rate limiting.

*   `docs/04-apis/rate-limiting.md`: Provides information on the rate limits imposed on API requests, including the number of requests allowed within a specific time frame.

## 7. SDK/Client Usage

The CryptoWave API supports integration through SDKs and client libraries.

*   `docs/04-apis/sdk-libraries.md`: Details the available SDKs and provides guidance on how to use them for interacting with the API.

## 8. Testing Instructions

TODO: Testing instructions are not provided in the CONTEXT.
