## 1. API Overview

The CryptoWave API provides access to cryptocurrency market data and trading functionalities. It is a RESTful API designed for developers to integrate cryptocurrency services into their applications.

The API documentation is structured across several files to provide a comprehensive understanding of its features and usage.

*   `docs/04-apis/api-overview.md`: Provides a general overview of the API.
*   `docs/04-apis/api.md`: Details the core API functionalities.
*   `docs/04-apis/rest-api/endpoints/README.md`: Lists and describes available REST API endpoints.
*   `docs/04-apis/rest-api/openapi.yaml`: Defines the API structure using OpenAPI Specification.

## 2. Authentication

TODO: Authentication details are not provided in the CONTEXT.

## 3. Endpoint Reference

The CryptoWave API exposes various endpoints for interacting with cryptocurrency data. The structure and details of these endpoints are defined in the OpenAPI specification and further elaborated in the documentation.

*   **OpenAPI Specification:** `docs/04-apis/rest-api/openapi.yaml` provides a machine-readable definition of the API, including all available endpoints, their parameters, and responses.
*   **Endpoint Listing:** `docs/04-apis/rest-api/endpoints/README.md` offers a human-readable list and description of the available REST API endpoints.
