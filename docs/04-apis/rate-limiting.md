# CryptoWave API Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the CryptoWave API, detailing its functionalities, endpoints, and error handling mechanisms.

## 1. API Overview

CryptoWave is a Flutter application that leverages the CoinGecko API to provide real-time cryptocurrency market data, price charts, and detailed coin information. The application's core functionality revolves around fetching and displaying this data to users. [S15, S16, S17, S18, S19, S20, S21, S22, S23, S24] The application's data fetching and management are handled through a repository pattern, abstracting direct API interactions. [S22]

## 2. Authentication

Authentication is not explicitly handled or documented within the provided code snippets. [S15, S19, S21, S22] Interactions with the CoinGecko API are assumed to be unauthenticated. [S22] All data is publicly accessible through the CoinGecko API. [S15, S16, S23]

## 3. Endpoint/Function Reference

The primary interaction with external data is handled through repositories that abstract API calls. [S16, S18, S20, S23] The `lib/repositories/coin_repository.dart` file is identified as relevant for API interactions. [S16, S18, S22] The `BaseRepository` class is also identified as a primary interaction point for API data. [S21]

### `ExceptionHandler.enhanceException`

This static method within the `ExceptionHandler` class is responsible for transforming base API exceptions into domain-specific exceptions with enhanced context. [S24]

**Parameters:**

*   `error`: The original exception object. [S24]
*   `contextMessage`: A string providing additional context. [S24]

## 4. Request/Response Examples

TODO: Provide examples for API requests and responses.

## 5. Error Handling

The `ExceptionHandler` class is responsible for transforming base API exceptions into domain-specific exceptions with enhanced context. [S13, S24]

## 6. Rate Limiting

TODO: Document rate limiting policies if applicable.

## 7. SDK/Client Usage Examples

TODO: Provide examples for SDK or client usage.

## 8. Testing Instructions

TODO: Provide instructions for testing API interactions.
