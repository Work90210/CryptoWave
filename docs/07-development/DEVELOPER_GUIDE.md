```

*   **`android/` & `ios/`:** Contain platform-specific project configurations and native code.
*   **`lib/`:** Houses all the Dart and Flutter code.
    *   **`main.dart`:** The entry point of the Flutter application.
    *   **`core/`:** Contains shared utilities, base classes, constants, and cross-cutting concerns used across multiple features. This promotes code reuse and consistency.
    *   **`features/`:** This is the core of the modular architecture. Each sub-directory represents a distinct feature of the application (e.g., `authentication`, `wallet`, `trading`). Each feature module is further divided into:
        *   **`data/`:** Handles data fetching, persistence, and API interactions. Includes repositories, data sources (API clients, local storage), and data models.
        *   **`domain/`:** Contains the core business logic, independent of any framework or platform. Includes entities (plain data classes), use cases (business operations), and repository interfaces.
        *   **`presentation/`:** Manages the UI and state management for the feature. Includes widgets, screens, view models, and state management logic (e.g., Provider, BLoC, Riverpod).
    *   **`generated/`:** Stores files generated by build tools or code generation processes.
    *   **`routes/`:** Defines the application's navigation structure and routes.
    *   **`theme/`:** Contains definitions for the application's visual theme, including colors, typography, and component styles.
*   **`test/`:** Contains unit, widget, and integration tests for the application. Tests are organized mirroring the `lib/` directory structure.
*   **Configuration Files:**
    *   **`pubspec.yaml`:** Manages project dependencies, assets, and metadata.
    *   **`analysis_options.yaml`:** Configures static analysis rules for Dart code.
    *   **`.gitignore`:** Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
    *   **`.env.example`:** Provides a template for environment-specific configuration.

## 3. Development Workflow

A typical development workflow within CryptoWave follows these steps:

1.  **Task Assignment:** Pick up a task from the project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello).
2.  **Branching:** Create a new feature branch from the `develop` branch. Use a descriptive naming convention (e.g., `feature/add-wallet-balance-display`, `fix/login-button-bug`).
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
3.  **Development:**
    *   Implement the feature or fix the bug, adhering to the project's coding standards.
    *   Write unit and widget tests for new code.
    *   Run the application locally to test changes.
    *   Ensure the code compiles and runs without errors on both Android and iOS.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Run all tests to ensure no regressions were introduced:
        ```bash
        flutter test
        ```
    *   Perform manual testing on emulators/simulators and physical devices.
5.  **Code Review:**
    *   Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
    *   Push your branch to the remote repository.
    *   Create a Pull Request (PR) targeting the `develop` branch.
    *   Request reviews from designated team members.
6.  **Address Feedback:**
    *   Review the feedback provided by your peers.
    *   Make necessary changes, commit them, and push them to your branch.
    *   The PR will be updated automatically.
7.  **Merging:**
    *   Once the PR is approved and all checks pass, it will be merged into the `develop` branch by a maintainer.
8.  **Continuous Integration (CI):** The CI pipeline will automatically run tests and checks on the `develop` branch after the merge.
9.  **Release Preparation:** Periodically, the `develop` branch is merged into the `main` (or `master`) branch for releases.

## 4. Coding Standards and Conventions

Adhering to consistent coding standards ensures code readability, maintainability, and collaboration.

### 4.1. Dart & Flutter Style Guide

*   **Official Style Guide:** Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) and [Flutter Style Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/formatting).
*   **Formatting:** Use `dart format` to automatically format your code. This is typically integrated into IDEs and CI pipelines.
    ```bash
    dart format .
    ```
*   **Linting:** The `analysis_options.yaml` file enforces linting rules. Ensure your code complies with these rules. Address all lints reported by `flutter analyze`.
    ```bash
    flutter analyze
    ```

### 4.2. Naming Conventions

*   **Classes and Types:** Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `WalletScreen`, `TransactionRepository`).
*   **Functions and Methods:** Use `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `fetchWalletBalance`, `navigateToDetails`).
*   **Variables:** Use `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `userProfile`, `transactionAmount`).
*   **Constants:** Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_KEY`, `MAX_RETRIES`).
*   **Private Members:** Prefix with an underscore `_` (e.g., `_privateVariable`, `_internalHelperMethod`).
*   **File Names:** Use `snake_case` for Dart files (e.g., `wallet_screen.dart`, `transaction_repository.dart`). Feature modules should follow `feature_name/` structure.

### 4.3. Project Structure Conventions

*   **Feature Modules:** Organize code by feature within the `lib/features/` directory. Each feature should have its own `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` subdirectories.
*   **`core/` Directory:** Place shared utilities, base classes, constants, and common widgets in the `core/` directory. Avoid placing feature-specific logic here.
*   **`routes/` Directory:** Centralize all navigation logic and route definitions.

### 4.4. State Management

*   **Consistency:** Use a consistent state management solution throughout the project. (TODO: Specify the primary state management solution used, e.g., Provider, Riverpod, BLoC).
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Maintain clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers.

### 4.5. Error Handling

*   **Custom Exceptions:** Define custom exception classes for specific error scenarios (e.g., `NetworkException`, `AuthenticationException`).
*   **Result Type:** Consider using a `Result` type or similar pattern for functions that can fail, to explicitly handle success and failure states.
*   **User Feedback:** Provide clear and user-friendly error messages to the user.

## 5. Testing Strategy

A robust testing strategy is crucial for maintaining code quality and stability. CryptoWave employs a multi-layered testing approach.

### 5.1. Unit Tests

*   **Purpose:** Test individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation.
*   **Location:** `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure (e.g., `test/features/authentication/domain/usecases/login_test.dart`).
*   **Tools:** `package:test` and `mockito` for mocking dependencies.
*   **Focus:** Business logic, domain models, use cases, and repository implementations.

### 5.2. Widget Tests

*   **Purpose:** Test individual Flutter widgets in isolation. Verify UI rendering, user interactions, and state changes within a widget.
*   **Location:** `test/` directory, often within feature directories (e.g., `test/features/wallet/presentation/widgets/balance_display_widget_test.dart`).
*   **Tools:** `flutter_test` package.
*   **Focus:** Widget appearance, responsiveness to user input, and correct rendering based on state.

### 5.3. Integration Tests

*   **Purpose:** Test the interaction between multiple components or features. Verify end-to-end flows.
*   **Location:** `integration_test/` directory.
*   **Tools:** `integration_test` package.
*   **Focus:** Testing complete user flows, such as login, transaction processing, or navigation between screens.

### 5.4. Running Tests

*   **All Tests:**
    ```bash
    flutter test
    ```
*   **Unit Tests Only:**
    ```bash
    flutter test --test-randomize-ordering test/
    ```
*   **Integration Tests:**
    ```bash
    flutter test integration_test/
    ```
    (Ensure an emulator/simulator is running for integration tests).

## 6. Debugging Guide
