## 3. Development Workflow

A typical development workflow involves fetching the latest changes, implementing a feature or fixing a bug, testing, and submitting for review.

1.  **Fetch Latest Changes:**
    *   Ensure your local `main` or `develop` branch is up-to-date:
        ```bash
        git checkout main # or develop
        git pull origin main # or develop
        ```
2.  **Create a New Branch:**
    *   Create a feature branch from the latest `main` (or `develop`):
        ```bash
        git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name # or bugfix/issue-number
        ```
3.  **Implement Feature/Fix Bug:**
    *   Write new code or modify existing code within the appropriate feature module in `lib/features/`.
    *   Adhere to the project's coding standards and conventions.
    *   Write unit and widget tests for your changes.
4.  **Run Tests:**
    *   Execute tests locally to ensure no regressions:
        ```bash
        flutter test
        ```
    *   For platform-specific tests (if any):
        *   Android: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
        *   iOS: `cd ios && xcodebuild test -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme Runner -sdk iphonesimulator`
5.  **Format Code:**
    *   Ensure code is formatted according to Dart standards:
        ```bash
        dart format .
        ```
6.  **Analyze Code:**
    *   Run static analysis to catch potential issues:
        ```bash
        dart analyze
        ```
7.  **Commit Changes:**
    *   Stage and commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: Implement user profile screen" # or fix: Resolve login button issue
        ```
8.  **Push Branch:**
    *   Push your feature branch to the remote repository:
        ```bash
        git push origin feature/your-feature-name
        ```
9.  **Create Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Open a new Pull Request on the project's repository, targeting the `main` (or `develop`) branch.
    *   Provide a clear description of your changes, including the problem solved and the solution implemented. Link to any relevant issues.

## 4. Coding Standards and Conventions

Adherence to consistent coding standards is crucial for maintainability and collaboration.

### 4.1. Dart/Flutter

*   **Formatting:** Use `dart format .` to automatically format your code.
*   **Linting:** Follow the rules defined in `analysis_options.yaml`. Run `dart analyze` to check for violations.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Classes:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfileScreen`, `WalletRepository`).
    *   **Functions/Methods:** `camelCase` (e.g., `fetchUserData`, `updateWalletBalance`).
    *   **Variables:** `camelCase` (e.g., `userName`, `transactionAmount`).
    *   **Constants:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_KEY`, `MAX_RETRIES`).
    *   **Private Members:** Prefix with an underscore `_` (e.g., `_privateVariable`, `_internalMethod`).
*   **File Naming:** Use `snake_case` for file names (e.g., `user_profile_screen.dart`, `wallet_repository.dart`).
*   **Feature Modules:** Organize code within feature modules following a layered architecture (e.g., `data`, `domain`, `presentation`).
*   **State Management:** Use the established state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, BLoC) consistently.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous code. Handle potential errors using `try-catch` blocks or `Result` types.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using custom exception classes and informative error messages.
*   **Comments:** Write clear and concise comments for complex logic or non-obvious code. Use `///` for documentation comments.

### 4.2. Kotlin (Android)

*   **Formatting:** Follow standard Kotlin formatting conventions. Android Studio's auto-formatter is generally sufficient.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Classes/Interfaces:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserViewModel`, `ApiService`).
    *   **Functions/Methods:** `camelCase` (e.g., `getUserData`, `updateProfile`).
    *   **Properties/Variables:** `camelCase` (e.g., `userName`, `transactionAmount`).
    *   **Constants:** `const val` for compile-time constants (`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`), `val` for runtime constants (`PascalCase` for object properties).
    *   **Private Members:** Prefix with an underscore `_`.
*   **Null Safety:** Utilize Kotlin's null safety features (`?`, `!!`, `?.`, `?:`).
*   **Coroutines:** Use Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations.
*   **Architecture Components:** Leverage Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Room, etc.) where appropriate.

### 4.3. Swift (iOS)

*   **Formatting:** Follow standard Swift formatting conventions. Xcode's auto-formatter is generally sufficient.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Classes/Structs/Enums/Protocols:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfileViewController`, `WalletService`).
    *   **Functions/Methods:** `camelCase` (e.g., `getUserData`, `updateProfile`).
    *   **Properties/Variables:** `camelCase` (e.g., `userName`, `transactionAmount`).
    *   **Constants:** `let` for constants (`camelCase` or `PascalCase` for type-level constants).
    *   **Private Members:** Prefix with an underscore `_`.
*   **Type Safety:** Utilize Swift's strong type system.
*   **Error Handling:** Use `do-catch` blocks for error handling with `throws` functions.
*   **CocoaPods:** Manage dependencies using the `Podfile`.

## 5. Testing Strategy

CryptoWave employs a multi-layered testing strategy to ensure code quality and stability.

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   **Location:** `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure.
    *   **Purpose:** Test individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation. Focus on business logic and domain layer.
    *   **Framework:** `package:test` and `mockito` for mocking dependencies.
    *   **Execution:** `flutter test`
*   **Widget Tests:**
    *   **Location:** `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure.
    *   **Purpose:** Test individual Flutter widgets and their UI interactions.
    *   **Framework:** `flutter_test` package.
    *   **Execution:** `flutter test`
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   **Location:** `integration_test/` directory.
    *   **Purpose:** Test the application as a whole, including interactions between different modules and services, often on a device or emulator.
    *   **Framework:** `integration_test` package.
    *   **Execution:** `flutter test integration_test/your_test_file.dart`
*   **Native Tests (Android/iOS):**
    *   **Location:** Within the `android/app/src/test` (unit) and `android/app/src/androidTest` (instrumented) directories for Android. For iOS, within the `ios/RunnerTests` and `ios/RunnerUITests` directories.
    *   **Purpose:** Test native platform-specific code or integrations.
    *   **Frameworks:** JUnit, Espresso (Android); XCTest (iOS).

**Best Practices:**
*   Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic.
*   Write clear, readable tests with descriptive names.
*   Mock external dependencies to ensure test isolation.
*   Run tests frequently during development.

## 6. Debugging Guide

Effective debugging is essential for identifying and resolving issues.

### 6.1. Flutter Debugging

*   **IDE Debugger:** Use the built-in debugger in Android Studio or VS Code. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code execution.
*   **`print()` Statements:** Use `print()` statements for quick checks of variable values or code execution flow. Remember to remove them before committing.
*   **Flutter DevTools:** Access DevTools via `flutter pub global activate devtools` and then `devtools`. It provides powerful tools for:
    *   **Inspector:** Inspect the widget tree, layout, and rendering.
    *   **Performance:** Profile CPU, memory, and network usage.
    *   **Logging:** View application logs.
    *   **Network:** Inspect network requests.
*   **Hot Reload/Restart:** Utilize hot reload for quick UI updates and hot restart for a more complete refresh of the application state.

### 6.2. Native Debugging (Android/iOS)

*   **Android Studio:**
    *   Attach the debugger to a running Android process.
    *   Use Logcat to view system and application logs. Filter by tags.
    *   Utilize the Layout Inspector to examine the view hierarchy.
*   **Xcode:**
    *   Attach the debugger to a running iOS process.
    *   Use the Console to view logs.
    *   Utilize the View Debugger to inspect the UI hierarchy.

### 6.3. Common Debugging Scenarios

*   **UI Glitches:** Use the Inspector/Layout Inspector to check widget/view properties, constraints, and rendering order.
*   **State Management Issues:** Log state changes and actions to understand how state is being updated.
*   **Network Errors:** Use the Network tab in DevTools or native network inspectors to examine request/response details and status codes.
*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** Profile your application using DevTools or native profiling tools to identify slow operations.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

This section addresses frequently encountered problems and their solutions.

*   **"Could not resolve all artifacts for ':app'" (Android Gradle Sync Failure):**
    *   **Cause:** Network issues preventing Gradle from downloading dependencies, or incorrect Gradle configuration.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Check your internet connection.
        *   Ensure `gradle-wrapper.properties` points to a valid Gradle version.
        *   Try cleaning the Gradle cache: `./gradlew cleanBuildCache` in the `android` directory.
        *   Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio.
*   **"No `podspec` found for `XYZ`" (iOS Pod Install Failure):**
    *   **Cause:** CocoaPods could not find the necessary `.podspec` file for a dependency.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Ensure you are running `pod install` from the `ios` directory.
        *   Check the `Podfile` for correct dependency names and versions.
        *   Try `pod repo update` to refresh your local CocoaPods repository.
*   **Build Failures after Flutter Upgrade:**
    *   **Cause:** Incompatibilities between Flutter SDK versions and project dependencies.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Run `flutter clean`.
        *   Run `flutter pub get`.
        *   Update platform-specific dependencies: `cd ios && pod install` and `./gradlew clean` in `android`.
*   **UI Not Updating:**
    *   **Cause:** State not being managed correctly, or hot reload not fully refreshing the UI.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Ensure your state management solution is correctly implemented and notifying listeners.
        *   Try a hot restart (`r` in the terminal) or a full app restart.
*   **Dependency Conflicts:**
    *   **Cause:** Multiple packages requiring different versions of the same transitive dependency.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Use `flutter pub upgrade` or `flutter pub outdated` to identify conflicts.
        *   Manually adjust versions in `pubspec.yaml` or use dependency overrides if necessary.
