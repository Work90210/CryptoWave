## 4. Coding Standards and Conventions

Adhering to consistent coding standards ensures code readability, maintainability, and collaboration.

### 4.1. Dart and Flutter Standards

*   **Linter:** The project uses the `analysis_options.yaml` file to enforce Dart and Flutter linting rules. Ensure your code passes all lints. Run `flutter analyze` to check.
*   **Formatting:** Use `dart format .` to automatically format your Dart code according to the standard Dart style guide.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Classes and Types:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `CryptoRepository`, `HomeScreen`).
    *   **Variables and Functions:** `camelCase` (e.g., `cryptoList`, `fetchCryptoData`).
    *   **Constants:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_KEY`, `MAX_RETRIES`).
    *   **Private Members:** Prefix with an underscore (`_`) (e.g., `_privateVariable`, `_privateMethod`).
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous code. Avoid excessive `.then()` chaining.
*   **Error Handling:** Use `try-catch` blocks for handling potential exceptions. Define custom exception types in `lib/core/errors/`.
*   **State Management:** Follow the established state management patterns (e.g., Riverpod, Provider) used within the `presentation/providers` directory.
*   **Widgets:**
    *   Keep widgets small and focused on a single responsibility.
    *   Use `const` constructors whenever possible for performance optimization.
    *   Organize widgets in `lib/presentation/widgets/`.

### 4.2. Kotlin (Android) Standards

*   **Style Guide:** Follow the official Kotlin Style Guide.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Classes and Objects:** `PascalCase`.
    *   **Functions and Properties:** `camelCase`.
    *   **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
*   **Null Safety:** Utilize Kotlin's null safety features to prevent null pointer exceptions.
*   **Coroutines:** Use Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations.

### 4.3. Swift (iOS) Standards

*   **Style Guide:** Follow the official Swift API Design Guidelines.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Types (Classes, Structs, Enums):** `PascalCase`.
    *   **Functions and Variables:** `camelCase`.
    *   **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
*   **Error Handling:** Use Swift's `try-catch` mechanism for error handling.
*   **Protocols:** Define protocols for abstractions and dependency injection.

### 4.4. YAML and JSON

*   **Indentation:** Use two spaces for indentation in YAML files.
*   **Key Naming:** Use `snake_case` for YAML keys where appropriate, especially in configuration files.
*   **JSON:** Follow standard JSON formatting.

### 4.5. Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

*   **Type:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
*   **Scope:** The part of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`).
*   **Description:** Concise summary of the change.
*   **Body:** More detailed explanation of the change, motivation, and context.
*   **Footer:** Used for breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE: ...`) or referencing issues (`Closes #123`).

```

## 5. Testing Strategy

CryptoWave employs a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality, stability, and correctness.

### 5.1. Unit Tests

*   **Location:** `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure.
*   **Purpose:** Verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation. Focus on business logic, utility functions, and data models.
*   **Framework:** `package:test` and `package:mocktail` for mocking dependencies.
*   **Execution:** Run `flutter test` from the project root.

**Example (Domain Layer):**

```dart
// lib/domain/usecases/get_crypto_list_usecase_test.dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mocktail/mocktail.dart';
import 'package:cryptowave/domain/entities/crypto_entity.dart';
import 'package:cryptowave/domain/repositories/crypto_repository.dart';
import 'package:cryptowave/domain/usecases/get_crypto_list_usecase.dart';

class MockCryptoRepository extends Mock implements CryptoRepository {}

void main() {
  late MockCryptoRepository mockCryptoRepository;
  late GetCryptoListUseCase getCryptoListUseCase;

  setUp(() {
    mockCryptoRepository = MockCryptoRepository();
    getCryptoListUseCase = GetCryptoListUseCase(mockCryptoRepository);
  });

  final tCryptoList = [
    const CryptoEntity(id: 'bitcoin', name: 'Bitcoin', symbol: 'BTC', priceUsd: '50000.0'),
    const CryptoEntity(id: 'ethereum', name: 'Ethereum', symbol: 'ETH', priceUsd: '3000.0'),
  ];

  test('should get list of cryptocurrencies from the repository', () async {
    // Arrange
    when(() => mockCryptoRepository.getCryptoList())
        .thenAnswer((_) async => Right(tCryptoList));

    // Act
    final result = await getCryptoListUseCase();

    // Assert
    expect(result, Right(tCryptoList));
    verify(() => mockCryptoRepository.getCryptoList()).called(1);
    verifyNoMoreInteractions(mockCryptoRepository);
  });
}
```

### 5.2. Widget Tests

*   **Location:** `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure.
*   **Purpose:** Verify that UI components (widgets) render correctly and respond to user interactions as expected.
*   **Framework:** `flutter_test` package.
*   **Execution:** Run `flutter test` from the project root.

**Example (Presentation Layer):**

```dart
// lib/presentation/widgets/crypto_list_item_test.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:cryptowave/presentation/widgets/crypto_list_item.dart';
import 'package:cryptowave/domain/entities/crypto_entity.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('CryptoListItem displays crypto data correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Arrange
    const crypto = CryptoEntity(id: 'bitcoin', name: 'Bitcoin', symbol: 'BTC', priceUsd: '50000.0');

    await tester.pumpWidget(
      MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          body: CryptoListItem(crypto: crypto),
        ),
      ),
    );

    // Assert
    expect(find.text('Bitcoin (BTC)'), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('\$50000.0'), findsOneWidget);
  });
}
```

### 5.3. Integration Tests

*   **Location:** `integration_test/` directory.
*   **Purpose:** Test the interaction between different parts of the application, including UI, business logic, and data layers. These tests run on a device or emulator.
*   **Framework:** `integration_test` package.
*   **Execution:**
    *   For Android: `flutter test integration_test/your_test_file.dart`
    *   For iOS: `flutter test integration_test/your_test_file.dart`

### 5.4. Platform-Specific Tests

*   **Android:** Unit tests for Kotlin code reside in the `android/app/src/test/` and `android/app/src/androidTest/` directories. Use JUnit and Espresso.
*   **iOS:** Unit tests for Swift code reside in the `ios/RunnerTests/` and `ios/RunnerUITests/` directories. Use XCTest.

## 6. Debugging Guide

This section provides guidance on debugging common issues within the CryptoWave application.

### 6.1. Using Flutter DevTools

Flutter DevTools is an essential suite of performance and debugging tools.

1.  **Launch DevTools:** Run your application in debug mode. In the terminal, you will see a message indicating DevTools is available. Click the link or run `flutter pub global activate devtools` and then `devtools`.
2.  **Key Features:**
    *   **Inspector:** Inspect the widget tree, view widget properties, and debug layout issues.
    *   **Performance:** Profile CPU usage, memory allocation, and frame rendering.
    *   **Logging:** View application logs, including `print` statements and framework logs.
    *   **Network:** Inspect network requests and responses.
    *   **App Size:** Analyze the size of your application.

### 6.2. Debugging with `print` Statements

Simple `print()` statements can be effective for tracing execution flow and inspecting variable values. Output appears in the IDE's run console or the terminal where the app was launched.

```dart
void myMethod(String data) {
  print('Entering myMethod with data: $data');
  // ... rest of the method
  print('Exiting myMethod');
}
```

### 6.3. Breakpoints and Step-Through Debugging

Most IDEs (Android Studio, VS Code) support setting breakpoints in your code.

1.  **Set Breakpoint:** Click in the gutter next to the line number where you want execution to pause.
2.  **Run in Debug Mode:** Launch the application using the debug option in your IDE.
3.  **Step Through:** When execution hits a breakpoint, use the IDE's debugging controls:
    *   **Step Over:** Execute the current line and move to the next.
    *   **Step Into:** If the current line is a function call, step into that function.
    *   **Step Out:** Continue execution until the current function returns.
    *   **Resume:** Continue execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.

### 6.4. Platform-Specific Debugging

*   **Android:** Use Android Studio's Logcat to view system and application logs. Filter by your application's package name or specific tags.
*   **iOS:** Use Xcode's console and the Devices and Simulators window to view logs.

### 6.5. Network Debugging

If you have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue to discuss it before starting implementation. This helps ensure alignment with project goals.

## 10. Code Review Process

Code reviews are a critical part of our development process to maintain code quality, share knowledge, and catch potential issues early.

### 10.1. Pull Request Submission

*   Ensure your PR targets the `develop` branch.
*   All automated checks (CI, linting) must pass.
*   Provide a comprehensive description of the changes, including the problem solved and the approach taken.
*   Link to any relevant issues.

### 10.2. Reviewer Responsibilities

*   **Timeliness:** Review PRs promptly, typically within 1-2 business days.
*   **Constructive Feedback:** Provide clear, actionable, and respectful feedback. Focus on the code, not the author.
*   **Thoroughness:** Review code for correctness, adherence to standards, potential bugs, performance implications, and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Approve or Request Changes:** Approve the PR if it meets all requirements, or request specific changes if necessary.

### 10.3. Author Responsibilities

*   **Respond to Feedback:** Address reviewer comments promptly and professionally.
*   **Make Changes:** Implement requested changes or provide clear explanations if you disagree.
*   **Push Updates:** Push updated code to your feature branch. The PR will automatically reflect these changes.
*   **Address Blocking Issues:** Resolve any blocking comments before the PR can be merged.

### 10.4. Merging Pull Requests

*   Once a PR has been approved by at least one reviewer and all automated checks pass, it can be merged.
*   The PR should be merged into the `develop` branch.
*   The feature branch can be deleted after a successful merge.
