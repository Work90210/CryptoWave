    *   **`shared/`:** Houses reusable components, widgets, utilities, or models that are used across multiple features.
*   **`test/`:** Contains all unit, widget, and integration tests for the application, mirroring the structure of `lib/`.
*   **`pubspec.yaml`:** The manifest file for the Flutter project, defining dependencies, assets, and metadata.
*   **`analysis_options.yaml`:** Configures the Dart analyzer to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues.
*   **`.gitignore`:** Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   **`README.md`:** Provides an overview of the project.

## 3. Development Workflow

A typical development workflow within CryptoWave involves the following steps:

1.  **Task Assignment:** Pick up a task from the project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello). Understand the requirements and acceptance criteria.
2.  **Branching Strategy:**
    *   Create a new feature branch from the `develop` branch. Use a descriptive naming convention, e.g., `feature/user-profile-update` or `fix/login-button-bug`.
    *   ```bash
        git checkout develop
        git pull origin develop
        git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
        ```
3.  **Development:**
    *   Implement the feature or fix the bug, adhering to the project's coding standards and architecture.
    *   Write unit and widget tests for new logic and UI components.
    *   Run the application on emulators or physical devices to test functionality.
    *   Use `flutter analyze` and `flutter format` regularly to maintain code quality.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Ensure all relevant tests pass (`flutter test`).
    *   Perform manual testing on target platforms (Android and iOS).
5.  **Committing:**
    *   Commit changes frequently with clear and concise commit messages.
    *   ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: Implement user profile editing functionality"
        ```
6.  **Pushing:**
    *   Push your feature branch to the remote repository.
    *   ```bash
        git push origin feature/your-feature-name
        ```
7.  **Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Create a Pull Request from your feature branch to the `develop` branch.
    *   Provide a clear description of the changes, including the problem solved, the solution implemented, and any relevant context. Link to the associated task/issue.
8.  **Code Review:**
    *   Your PR will be reviewed by other team members. Address feedback promptly and make necessary adjustments.
9.  **Merging:**
    *   Once the PR is approved and all checks pass, it will be merged into the `develop` branch.
10. **Release/Main Branch Update:** Periodically, the `develop` branch is merged into the `main` (or `master`) branch for releases.

## 4. Coding Standards and Conventions

Adhering to consistent coding standards is crucial for maintainability and collaboration.

### 4.1. Dart & Flutter Style Guide

*   **Official Style Guide:** Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) and [Flutter Style Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/formatting).
*   **Formatting:** Use `dart format` to automatically format your code. This is often integrated into IDEs.
*   **Linting:** The `analysis_options.yaml` file is configured with a comprehensive set of lints to enforce style and catch potential errors. Ensure your code passes all linting checks.

### 4.2. Naming Conventions

*   **Classes and Types:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfile`, `WalletRepository`).
*   **Functions and Methods:** `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `fetchUserData`, `updateProfile`).
*   **Variables:** `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `userName`, `isLoading`).
*   **Constants:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_KEY`, `MAX_RETRIES`).
*   **Private Members:** Prefix with an underscore (`_`) (e.g., `_privateVariable`, `_internalMethod`).
*   **Enums:** `PascalCase` for the enum type, `PascalCase` for enum values (e.g., `enum Status { Loading, Success, Error }`).
*   **File Names:** `lower_snake_case` for Dart files (e.g., `user_profile_page.dart`). Feature modules should follow `feature_name/` structure.
*   **Widgets:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `CustomButton`, `UserProfileCard`).

### 4.3. Project Structure Adherence

*   **Feature Modules:** New features should be created as new modules within the `lib/features/` directory.
*   **Layered Architecture:** Maintain the `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` separation within each feature module.
*   **Shared Components:** Place reusable widgets, utilities, or models in the `lib/shared/` directory.

### 4.4. State Management

*   CryptoWave primarily uses [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) for state management.
*   Organize providers logically within feature modules or shared directories.
*   Prefer immutable state and functional programming paradigms where applicable.

### 4.5. Error Handling

*   Implement robust error handling using custom exception classes and a consistent error reporting mechanism.
*   Utilize the `core/errors/` directory for defining error types and failure classes.

### 4.6. Asynchronous Operations

*   Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations.
*   Handle potential errors using `try-catch` blocks.
*   Consider using `FutureBuilder` or Riverpod's `FutureProvider` for managing asynchronous states in the UI.

## 5. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy ensures the reliability and stability of CryptoWave.

### 5.1. Unit Tests

*   **Purpose:** Test individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation.
*   **Location:** `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure (e.g., `test/features/authentication/domain/usecases/login_usecase_test.dart`).
*   **Framework:** `package:test` and `package:mocktail` for mocking dependencies.
*   **Focus:** Business logic, use cases, repository implementations, utility functions.
*   **Coverage:** Aim for high unit test coverage for critical business logic.

### 5.2. Widget Tests

*   **Purpose:** Test individual Flutter widgets in isolation, verifying their UI and interaction.
*   **Location:** `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure (e.g., `test/features/authentication/presentation/widgets/login_form_widget_test.dart`).
*   **Framework:** `flutter_test` package.
*   **Focus:** Widget rendering, user interactions (taps, text input), state changes within the widget.

### 5.3. Integration Tests

*   **Purpose:** Test the interaction between multiple components or features, simulating real user flows.
*   **Location:** `integration_test/` directory.
*   **Framework:** `integration_test` package.
*   **Focus:** End-to-end testing of user journeys, ensuring different parts of the application work together correctly. These tests run on a device or emulator.

### 5.4. Mocking

*   Use `package:mocktail` for creating mock objects for dependencies like repositories, services, and data sources.
*   Mocking allows you to isolate the unit under test and control its dependencies.

### 5.5. Running Tests

*   **Unit & Widget Tests:**
    ```bash
    flutter test
    ```
    To run tests for a specific file:
    ```bash
    flutter test test/features/authentication/domain/usecases/login_usecase_test.dart
    ```
*   **Integration Tests:**
    ```bash
    flutter test integration_test/your_integration_test.dart
    ```
    Ensure a device or emulator is connected and running.

## 6. Debugging Guide

Effective debugging is essential for identifying and resolving issues.

### 6.1. Using IDE Debugger

*   **Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA:**
    *   Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
    *   Run the application in debug mode (usually a bug icon).
    *   Use the debug toolbar to step over, step into, step out of functions, and inspect variable values.
*   **VS Code:**
    *   Ensure you have the Dart/Flutter extensions installed.
    *   Set breakpoints in your `.dart` files.
    *   Launch the Flutter debugger from the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D).

### 6.2. Logging

*   Utilize the `dart:developer` library for logging.
    ```dart
    import 'dart:developer' as developer;

    // ...

    developer.log('User logged in successfully', name: 'AuthService');
    ```
*   Consider using a dedicated logging package like `logger` for more advanced features (e.g., log levels, formatting, output destinations).

### 6.3. Flutter DevTools

*   Flutter DevTools is a powerful suite of performance and debugging tools.
*   **Access:**
    *   When running in debug mode, DevTools will often open automatically in your browser.
    *   Alternatively, run `flutter pub global activate devtools` and then `devtools` in your terminal.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Inspector:** Inspect the widget tree, view widget properties, and debug layout issues.
    *   **Performance:** Profile CPU usage, frame rendering times, and identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Network:** Inspect network requests and responses.
    *   **Logging:** View application logs.
    *   **Memory:** Analyze memory usage.

### 6.4. Hot Reload and Hot Restart

*   **Hot Reload (r):** Injects updated code into the running Dart VM. Preserves application state. Ideal for UI changes.
*   **Hot Restart (R):** Resets the application state and restarts the Dart VM. Useful for more significant code changes or when hot reload doesn't work as expected.

### 6.5. Assertions

*   Use `assert()` statements for debugging logic that should always hold true in development builds.
    ```dart
    assert(user != null, 'User object cannot be null');
    ```
    Assertions are only active in debug and profile modes.

## 7. Deployment Process

The deployment process ensures that new versions of CryptoWave are released to users reliably.

### 7.1. Build Process

*   **Android:**
    *   Generate a signed APK or App Bundle using Gradle.
    *   ```bash
        # For App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
        flutter build appbundle --release

        # For APK
        flutter build apk --release
        ```
    *   The output will be in the `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/` or `build/app/outputs/apk/release/` directory.

*   **iOS:**
    *   Build and archive the application using Xcode.
    *   ```bash
        flutter build ipa --release
        ```
    *   This command generates an `.ipa` file, typically located in `build/ios/ipa/`. You can then distribute this via TestFlight or upload it to App Store Connect.

### 7.2. CI/CD Pipeline

*   CryptoWave utilizes a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
*   **Tools:** [TODO: Specify CI/CD tools used, e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins].
*   **Triggers:** The pipeline is typically triggered by pushes to specific branches (e.g., `main` for releases, `develop` for staging).
*   **Stages:**
    1.  **Checkout:** Fetches the latest code.
    2.  **Setup:** Installs Flutter SDK, dependencies, and environment variables.
    3.  **Analyze:** Runs `flutter analyze`.
    4.  **Test:** Executes unit, widget, and integration tests.
    5.  **Build:** Creates release builds for Android and iOS.
    6.  **Deploy:** Uploads builds to distribution platforms (e.g., App Store Connect, Google Play Console, Firebase App Distribution).

### 7.3. Release Management

*   **Versioning:** Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for application versioning (`major.minor.patch`).
*   **Branching:** Releases are typically cut from the `main` branch.
*   **Deployment Platforms:**
    *   **Android:** Google Play Store.
    *   **iOS:** App Store (via TestFlight for beta testing).
