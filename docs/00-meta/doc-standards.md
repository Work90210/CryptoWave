## Documentation Standards and Guidelines

This document outlines the standards and guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation within this codebase. Adherence to these guidelines ensures clarity, consistency, and accuracy across all project documentation.

### 1. Writing Standards

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   **Direct Language:** Use clear, unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice.
    *   **Active Voice:** Prefer active voice for a more direct and engaging tone.
    *   **Short Sentences and Paragraphs:** Break down complex information into easily digestible segments.
    *   **Action-Oriented:** Focus on what the user can do or what the system does.
*   **Technical Writing Best Practices:**
    *   **Audience Awareness:** Tailor content to the intended audience.

### 2. Content Structure

TODO: Content structure, required sections, and information hierarchy principles are not detailed in the provided context.

### 3. Quality Standards

*   **Accuracy Requirements:** Documentation must be technically accurate.
*   **Completeness Criteria:**
    *   **Feature Coverage:** Percentage of documented features against the total number of features in the application.
*   **Review and Approval Processes:** Documentation undergoes a structured review process including Authoring, Technical Review, and Editorial Review to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to standards.
*   **Update Frequency Guidelines:**
    *   **Regular Review Cycles:** Core documentation sections undergo a comprehensive review quarterly. Feature-specific documentation is reviewed bi-annually, coinciding with major release cycles or feature updates.
    *   **Update Triggers:** Significant changes to the codebase trigger documentation updates.

### 4. Style Guidelines

*   **Code Examples Formatting:** TODO: Specific formatting conventions for code examples are not detailed.
*   **Screenshot and Diagram Standards:** TODO: Standards for screenshots and diagrams are not detailed.
*   **Link and Reference Formatting:** TODO: Link and reference formatting standards are not detailed.
*   **Version Control Practices:**
    *   **Documentation Versioning Schemes:** Documentation versions align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer). Major documentation changes correspond to major application version updates, and minor documentation updates align with minor application version updates.
