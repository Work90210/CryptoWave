## Documentation Standards and Guidelines

This document outlines the standards and guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation within this codebase. Adherence to these guidelines ensures clarity, consistency, and accuracy across all project documentation.

### 1. Writing Standards

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   Use clear, unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice.
    *   Prefer active voice for a more direct and engaging tone.
    *   Break down complex information into easily digestible segments using short sentences and paragraphs.
    *   Focus on what the user can do or what the system does.
*   **Technical Writing Best Practices:**
    *   Tailor content to the intended audience.
*   **Tone and Voice:**
    *   TODO: Tone and voice guidelines are not specified in the provided context.
*   **Formatting Conventions:**
    *   Markdown is used for writing all documentation content.

### 2. Content Structure

*   **Standard Document Organization:**
    *   The `README.md` file serves as the entry point, providing a high-level overview, key features, and the technology stack.
    *   `README.md` includes sections for Project Overview, Features, and Tech Stack.
*   **Required Sections for Different Doc Types:**
    *   TODO: Specific required sections for different document types are not detailed.
*   **Information Hierarchy Principles:**
    *   TODO: Information hierarchy principles are not detailed.

### 3. Quality Standards

*   **Accuracy Requirements:**
    *   Documentation must be technically accurate.
*   **Completeness Criteria:**
    *   **Feature Coverage:** Percentage of documented features against the total number of features in the application. This is measured by comparing documented features in `README.md` and other relevant documentation files against the application's feature set.
*   **Review and Approval Processes:**
    *   Documentation undergoes a structured review process.
    *   **Documentation Review Stages:**
        1.  Authoring: Initial creation by a subject matter expert or technical writer.
        2.  Technical Review: Peer review by subject matter experts or senior engineers for technical accuracy, completeness, and correctness.
        3.  Editorial Review: Review by a dedicated editor or documentation specialist for adherence to standards.
*   **Update Frequency Guidelines:**
    *   **Quarterly Review:** All core documentation sections will undergo a comprehensive review every quarter. This includes API documentation, user guides, and architectural overviews.
    *   **Bi-Annual Feature Documentation Review:** Documentation related to specific features or components will be reviewed bi-annually, coinciding with major release cycles or feature updates.
    *   **Update Triggers:** Significant changes to the codebase trigger documentation updates.

### 4. Style Guidelines

*   **Code Examples Formatting:**
    *   TODO: Code example formatting standards are not specified.
*   **Screenshot and Diagram Standards:**
    *   TODO: Screenshot and diagram standards are not specified.
*   **Link and Reference Formatting:**
    *   TODO: Link and reference formatting standards are not specified.
*   **Version Control Practices:**
    *   Documentation versions will align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer).
    *   Major documentation changes correspond to major application version updates.
    *   Minor documentation updates align with minor application version updates.
