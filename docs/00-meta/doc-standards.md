## Documentation Standards and Guidelines

This document outlines the standards and guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation within this codebase. Adherence to these guidelines ensures clarity, consistency, and accuracy across all project documentation.

### 1. Writing Standards

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   **Direct Language:** Use clear, unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice.
    *   **Active Voice:** Prefer active voice for a more direct and engaging tone.
    *   **Short Sentences and Paragraphs:** Break down complex information into easily digestible segments.
    *   **Action-Oriented:** Focus on what the user can do or what the system does.
*   **Technical Writing Best Practices:**
    *   **Audience Awareness:** Tailor content to the intended audience.

### 2. Content Structure

TODO: Content structure, required sections, and information hierarchy principles are not detailed in the provided context.

### 3. Quality Standards

*   **Accuracy Requirements:** Documentation must be technically accurate.
*   **Completeness Criteria:**
    *   **Feature Coverage:** Percentage of documented features against the total number of features in the application.
*   **Review and Approval Processes:** Documentation undergoes a structured review process to guarantee accuracy, clarity, and adherence to standards. This includes:
    *   **Authoring:** Initial creation of documentation.
    *   **Technical Review:** Peer review by subject matter experts or senior engineers for technical accuracy, completeness, and correctness.
    *   **Editorial Review:** Review by a dedicated editor or documentation specialist for adherence to standards.
*   **Update Frequency Guidelines:**
    *   **Quarterly Review:** All core documentation sections will undergo a comprehensive review every quarter.
    *   **Bi-Annual Feature Documentation Review:** Documentation related to specific features or components will be reviewed bi-annually, coinciding with major release cycles or feature updates.
    *   **Code Changes:** Significant changes to the codebase trigger documentation updates.

### 4. Style Guidelines

*   **Code Examples Formatting:** TODO: Specific formatting for code examples is not detailed.
*   **Screenshot and Diagram Standards:** TODO: Standards for screenshots and diagrams are not detailed.
*   **Link and Reference Formatting:** TODO: Standards for link and reference formatting are not detailed.
*   **Version Control Practices:** Documentation versions will align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer) where applicable. Major documentation changes will correspond to major application version updates, and minor documentation updates will align with minor application version updates.
