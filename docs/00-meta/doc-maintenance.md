## Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

This document outlines the procedures and policies for maintaining up-to-date and accurate documentation. Adherence to these guidelines ensures that our documentation remains a reliable resource for users and developers.

### 1. Maintenance Schedule

#### 1.1. Regular Review Cycles

*   **Quarterly Review:** All core documentation sections will undergo a comprehensive review every quarter. This includes API documentation, user guides, and architectural overviews.
*   **Bi-Annual Feature Documentation Review:** Documentation related to specific features or components will be reviewed bi-annually, coinciding with major release cycles or feature updates.

#### 1.2. Update Triggers and Alerts

*   **Code Changes:** Any significant change to the codebase requires a review and potential update of related documentation.

#### 1.3. Responsibility Assignments

TODO: Responsibility assignments for documentation maintenance are not specified in the provided context.

#### 1.4. Maintenance Task Prioritization

TODO: Maintenance task prioritization is not specified in the provided context.

### 2. Update Processes

#### 2.1. When to Update Documentation

Documentation should be updated when:
*   Codebase changes occur that affect existing functionality or introduce new features.
*   There are changes in project architecture or design.
*   API endpoints are modified or added.
*   User interface elements or workflows are altered.

#### 2.2. How to Identify Outdated Content

Outdated content can be identified through:
*   Discrepancies found during the regular review cycles.
*   User feedback indicating inaccuracies or missing information.
*   Automated checks for broken links or deprecated syntax.

#### 2.3. Change Management Workflows

TODO: Specific change management workflows for documentation are not detailed in the provided context.

#### 2.4. Impact Assessment Procedures

TODO: Impact assessment procedures for documentation changes are not detailed in the provided context.

### 3. Quality Assurance

#### 3.1. Documentation Auditing Processes

TODO: Documentation auditing processes are not specified in the provided context.

#### 3.2. Accuracy Verification Methods

Accuracy verification involves:
*   **Technical Review:** A peer review by subject matter experts or senior engineers to validate technical accuracy, completeness, and correctness.

#### 3.3. Consistency Checks

Consistency checks ensure adherence to established documentation standards and guidelines.

#### 3.4. User Feedback Integration

User feedback is integrated to identify areas for improvement and address inaccuracies.

### 4. Automation & Tools

#### 4.1. Automated Content Validation

TODO: Specific tools or processes for automated content validation are not detailed in the provided context.

#### 4.2. Link Checking Procedures

TODO: Specific procedures for link checking are not detailed in the provided context.

#### 4.3. Version Synchronization

Documentation versions will align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer) where applicable. Major documentation changes will correspond to major version updates of the application. Minor documentation updates will align with minor application version updates.

#### 4.4. Documentation Metrics Tracking

Key performance indicators (KPIs) and quality metrics are used to measure the value and effectiveness of the documentation. This includes metrics such as:
*   **Feature Coverage:** Percentage of documented features against the total number of features in the application.
