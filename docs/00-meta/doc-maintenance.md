## Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

This document outlines the procedures and policies for maintaining up-to-date and accurate documentation. Adherence to these guidelines ensures that our documentation remains a reliable resource for users and developers.

### 1. Maintenance Schedule

**1.1. Regular Review Cycles:**

*   **Quarterly Review:** All core documentation sections will undergo a comprehensive review every quarter. This includes API documentation, user guides, and architectural overviews.
*   **Bi-Annual Feature Documentation Review:** Documentation related to specific features or components will be reviewed bi-annually, coinciding with major release cycles or feature updates.

**1.2. Update Triggers and Alerts:**

*   **Code Changes:** Any significant change to the codebase, including new features, refactoring, or deprecations, automatically triggers a review of related documentation.
*   **API Changes:** Modifications to API endpoints, parameters, or response structures necessitate immediate documentation updates.
*   **User Feedback:** Alerts are generated for documentation-related feedback received through designated channels (e.g., issue trackers, feedback forms).
*   **Release Cadence:** Documentation updates are a mandatory part of the release process for new versions or significant updates.

**1.3. Responsibility Assignments:**

*   **Feature Owners:** Responsible for maintaining documentation related to their specific features or components.
*   **Technical Writers/Documentation Team:** Oversee the overall documentation strategy, conduct audits, and ensure consistency and quality across all documentation.
*   **Development Leads:** Responsible for ensuring that documentation is considered during the development lifecycle and that relevant updates are made.

**1.4. Maintenance Task Prioritization:**

*   **Critical Updates:** Documentation directly impacting critical functionality, security, or breaking changes receives the highest priority.
*   **High Priority:** Updates for new features, significant bug fixes, or urgent user feedback.
*   **Medium Priority:** General improvements, clarifications, and updates for non-critical changes.
*   **Low Priority:** Minor edits, grammatical corrections, and stylistic improvements.

### 2. Update Processes

**2.1. When to Update Documentation:**

*   **New Feature Introduction:** Documentation must be created or updated concurrently with the development of new features.
*   **Bug Fixes:** If a bug fix significantly alters behavior or requires specific user action, the documentation must be updated to reflect this.
*   **Deprecation or Removal:** When features or APIs are deprecated or removed, documentation must clearly indicate this and provide guidance on alternatives.
*   **Process or Policy Changes:** Any changes in development processes, deployment strategies, or operational procedures that affect users or developers require corresponding documentation updates.
*   **User Feedback Implementation:** When user feedback identifies inaccuracies, omissions, or areas of confusion, documentation must be revised.

**2.2. How to Identify Outdated Content:**

*   **Code Audits:** Regular comparison of documentation against the codebase to identify discrepancies.
*   **Automated Checks:** Utilizing tools to scan for broken links, outdated code examples, or missing cross-references.
*   **User Feedback Analysis:** Monitoring user feedback for recurring questions or reported issues that indicate documentation gaps or inaccuracies.
*   **Version Control History:** Reviewing commit messages and change logs for relevant code modifications that may impact documentation.

**2.3. Change Management Workflows:**

*   **Documentation Pull Requests:** All documentation changes are submitted via pull requests, requiring review by at least one other team member (e.g., a peer developer, technical writer, or product manager).
*   **Review Criteria:** Reviews focus on accuracy, clarity, completeness, and adherence to style guides.
*   **Staging Environment:** For significant documentation updates, a staging environment may be used for final review before deployment.

**2.4. Impact Assessment Procedures:**

*   **Scope Definition:** Before implementing changes, assess the scope of the documentation update and its potential impact on users and other documentation.
*   **Cross-referencing:** Identify and update any related documentation that might be affected by the change.
*   **Version Control:** Maintain a clear history of documentation changes using version control systems.

### 3. Quality Assurance

**3.1. Documentation Auditing Processes:**

*   **Scheduled Audits:** Formal audits are conducted quarterly by the documentation team to assess the overall health and accuracy of the documentation suite.
*   **Ad-hoc Reviews:** Peer reviews are integrated into the development workflow for all documentation changes.

**3.2. Accuracy Verification Methods:**

*   **Code Walkthroughs:** Developers verify that documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.
*   **Testing:** Documentation examples and procedures are tested to ensure they function as described.
*   **Subject Matter Expert (SME) Review:** For complex or critical documentation, SMEs review for technical accuracy.

**3.3. Consistency Checks:**

*   **Style Guide Adherence:** All documentation must adhere to the established style guide, ensuring consistent terminology, formatting, and tone.
*   **Template Utilization:** Standardized templates are used for different types of documentation (e.g., API references, tutorials) to maintain structural consistency.

**3.4. User Feedback Integration:**

*   **Feedback Channels:** Establish clear channels for users to provide feedback on documentation (e.g., comment sections, dedicated email, issue tracker).
*   **Feedback Triage:** Regularly review and categorize user feedback to identify common issues and prioritize updates.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Feedback is used to refine existing content, identify gaps, and improve the overall documentation strategy.

### 4. Automation & Tools

**4.1. Automated Content Validation:**

*   **Linters and Formatters:** Integrate linters (e.g., Vale, markdownlint) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for style guide violations and formatting errors.
*   **Code Example Validation:** Scripts are used to validate the correctness of code snippets and examples within the documentation.

**4.2. Link Checking Procedures:**

*   **Automated Link Checkers:** Regularly run automated tools (e.g., `lychee`, `markdown-link-check`) to identify and report broken internal and external links.
*   **CI Integration:** Link checking is integrated into the CI pipeline to catch broken links before they are merged.

**4.3. Version Synchronization:**

*   **Branching Strategy:** Documentation is maintained in version control alongside the codebase, using branches that correspond to release versions.
*   **Tagging:** Documentation versions are tagged to align with software releases, ensuring users can access documentation relevant to specific versions.

**4.4. Documentation Metrics Tracking:**

*   **Usage Analytics:** Monitor page views, search queries, and user engagement with documentation to identify popular or neglected content.
*   **Feedback Metrics:** Track the volume and nature of user feedback to gauge the effectiveness of documentation updates.
*   **Review Cadence Adherence:** Monitor adherence to the defined review schedules and identify any backlogs.
