## Version Control and Documentation Lifecycle Management

This document outlines the strategies for version control and lifecycle management of documentation within the project.

### 1. Version Control Strategy

A systematic approach to version control ensures the integrity, traceability, and accessibility of documentation.

#### 1.1. Documentation Versioning Schemes

*   **Semantic Versioning for Documentation:** Documentation versions will align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer) where applicable. Major documentation changes (e.g., significant feature additions, architectural shifts) will correspond to major version updates of the application. Minor documentation updates (e.g., feature enhancements, API changes) will align with minor application version updates. Patch-level documentation changes (e.g., bug fixes, minor corrections) will correspond to patch application version updates.
*   **Branching for Features and Fixes:**
    *   **`main` Branch:** Represents the stable, production-ready documentation.
    *   **`develop` Branch:** Integrates ongoing documentation changes and features.
    *   **Feature Branches:** Created from `develop` for new documentation sections or significant revisions. Branches are named descriptively, e.g., `feature/add-api-reference`, `fix/update-installation-guide`.
    *   **Hotfix Branches:** Created from `main` for urgent documentation corrections in production. Branches are named descriptively, e.g., `hotfix/correct-typo-in-readme`.
*   **Merge Strategies:**
    *   **Pull Requests (PRs):** All changes to `develop` and `main` branches must go through a PR.
    *   **Squash and Merge:** Feature branches are typically squashed into `develop` to maintain a clean commit history.
    *   **Rebase and Merge:** Hotfix branches are rebased onto `main` before merging to ensure a linear history.
*   **Release Tagging Conventions:**
    *   Documentation versions will be tagged using Git tags that directly correspond to the application's release versions.
    *   Tags will follow the format `vX.Y.Z`, where X, Y, and Z represent major, minor, and patch versions, respectively. For example, `v1.2.3`.
    *   Tags will be applied to the `main` branch upon successful release.
*   **Backward Compatibility Considerations:**
    *   Documentation for deprecated features or APIs will be clearly marked as such and retained for a defined period to support users on older versions.
    *   When breaking changes are introduced in the application that impact documentation, version-specific documentation will be maintained, clearly indicating compatibility.

### 2. Lifecycle Management

A structured lifecycle ensures that documentation is created, reviewed, published, and maintained effectively.

#### 2.1. Documentation Creation Workflows

*   **Initiation:** Documentation tasks are initiated based on new feature development, bug fixes, or identified gaps in existing documentation. These tasks are typically created as issues in the project's issue tracker.
*   **Content Development:** Authors create documentation in a designated branch, adhering to style guides and templates. Markdown is the primary format for most documentation.
*   **Integration with Development:** Documentation is developed concurrently with code changes. For new features, initial drafts of relevant documentation are created during the development phase.

#### 2.2. Review and Approval Processes

*   **Peer Review:** All documentation changes are subject to peer review via Pull Requests. Reviewers verify accuracy, clarity, completeness, and adherence to style guidelines.
*   **Technical Review:** For significant technical documentation (e.g., architectural overviews, API references), a technical lead or subject matter expert conducts a thorough review.
*   **Approval:** Once reviewed and approved, changes are merged into the `develop` branch. Merging to `main` is reserved for release-tagged versions.

#### 2.3. Publication and Distribution

*   **Automated Publishing:** Documentation is published automatically upon merging to the `main` branch. This process is typically integrated with a CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Distribution Channels:**
    *   **Project Repository:** The primary source of truth for all documentation is the project's version control repository.
    *   **Website/Wiki:** A dedicated documentation website or project wiki will serve as the publicly accessible distribution channel, pulling content directly from the repository.
    *   **In-App Help (if applicable):** For user-facing documentation, relevant sections may be integrated directly into the application.

#### 2.4. Archival and Deprecation Procedures

*   **Archival:** Older versions of documentation are retained in the version control system and can be accessed via specific tags. The published documentation website will also maintain historical versions.
*   **Deprecation:** When features or APIs are deprecated, the corresponding documentation will be clearly marked with deprecation notices, including information about the replacement and the version in which the deprecation occurred. Deprecated documentation will be retained for a defined period before being archived.

### 3. Change Management

A structured approach to managing changes ensures that documentation remains accurate and relevant.

#### 3.1. Change Tracking Methodologies

*   **Version Control:** All documentation changes are tracked using Git, providing a complete history of modifications, authors, and timestamps.
*   **Issue Tracking:** Documentation updates are linked to specific issues or tasks in the project's issue tracking system, providing context and traceability for each change.
*   **Commit Messages:** Clear and concise commit messages are mandatory, summarizing the changes made to the documentation.

#### 3.2. Impact Assessment Processes

*   **Scope Definition:** Before implementing documentation changes, the scope and potential impact on existing documentation and users are assessed.
*   **Cross-referencing:** Changes that affect other documentation sections or related systems are identified, and necessary updates are planned.

#### 3.3. Rollback and Recovery Procedures

*   **Revert Commits:** In case of erroneous documentation changes, Git's revert functionality is used to undo specific commits.
*   **Branching Strategy:** The branching strategy allows for easy rollback by reverting or cherry-picking specific commits from stable branches.
*   **Backup:** Regular backups of the documentation repository are maintained to ensure data recovery.

#### 3.4. Change Communication Strategies

*   **Pull Request Reviews:** Discussions and feedback during PR reviews serve as a primary communication channel for documentation changes.
*   **Release Notes:** Significant documentation updates are highlighted in the release notes accompanying application updates.
*   **Team Communication:** Relevant stakeholders are informed of critical documentation changes through team communication channels (e.g., Slack, email).

### 4. Integration & Sync

Seamless integration and synchronization of documentation with the development process are crucial for maintaining accuracy and efficiency.

#### 4.1. Code-Documentation Synchronization

*   **Docstrings and Comments:** Code comments and docstrings are maintained as the primary source for API-level documentation. These are integrated into the documentation generation process.
*   **Automated Generation:** Tools are employed to generate API documentation directly from code comments and docstrings.

#### 4.2. Automated Version Updates

*   **CI/CD Integration:** The CI/CD pipeline automatically updates documentation versions and tags in the repository upon successful builds and deployments.
*   **Build Scripts:** Build scripts are configured to automatically update version numbers in documentation files where applicable.

#### 4.3. Cross-Reference Maintenance

*   **Link Validation:** Automated checks are implemented to ensure that all internal and external links within the documentation remain valid. Broken links are flagged for correction.
*   **Consistent Referencing:** A standardized approach to cross-referencing is enforced through style guides and linters.

#### 4.4. Dependency Management

*   **Documentation Tool Dependencies:** All tools and libraries used for documentation generation (e.g., Markdown processors, static site generators) are managed as project dependencies.
*   **Version Pinning:** Dependencies are version-pinned to ensure consistent build environments and prevent unexpected behavior due to dependency updates.
