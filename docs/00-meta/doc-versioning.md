## Version Control and Documentation Lifecycle Management

### 1. Version Control Strategy

A systematic approach to version control ensures the integrity, traceability, and accessibility of documentation.

#### 1.1. Documentation Versioning Schemes

Documentation versions will align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer) where applicable. Major documentation changes will correspond to major version updates of the application. Minor documentation updates will align with minor application version updates. Patch-level documentation updates will align with patch application version updates.

#### 1.2. Branch and Merge Strategies

TODO: Branch and merge strategies for documentation are not specified in the provided context.

#### 1.3. Release Tagging Conventions

TODO: Release tagging conventions for documentation are not specified in the provided context.

#### 1.4. Backward Compatibility Considerations

TODO: Backward compatibility considerations for documentation are not specified in the provided context.

### 2. Lifecycle Management

#### 2.1. Documentation Creation Workflows

The primary README file (`README.md`) serves as the entry point for understanding the project, providing a high-level overview, key features, and the technology stack. Documentation is written using Markdown.

#### 2.2. Review and Approval Processes

Documentation undergoes a structured review process to guarantee accuracy, clarity, and adherence to standards. The review process consists of the following stages:
1.  **Authoring:** The initial creation of documentation by the subject matter expert or technical writer.
2.  **Technical Review:** A peer review by subject matter experts or senior engineers to validate technical accuracy, completeness, and correctness.
3.  **Editorial Review:** A review by a dedicated editor or documentation specialist to ensure adherence to standards.

#### 2.3. Publication and Distribution

The primary platform for managing and presenting project documentation is Markdown, rendered through a static site generator or directly within version control platforms.

#### 2.4. Archival and Deprecation Procedures

TODO: Archival and deprecation procedures for documentation are not specified in the provided context.

### 3. Change Management

#### 3.1. Change Tracking Methodologies

Documentation is managed alongside the codebase using a Version Control System (e.g., Git), enabling version tracking, branching, and collaborative workflows.

#### 3.2. Impact Assessment Processes

TODO: Impact assessment processes for documentation changes are not specified in the provided context.

#### 3.3. Rollback and Recovery Procedures

TODO: Rollback and recovery procedures for documentation are not specified in the provided context.

#### 3.4. Change Communication Strategies

TODO: Change communication strategies for documentation are not specified in the provided context.

### 4. Integration & Sync

#### 4.1. Code-Documentation Synchronization

Documentation is managed alongside the codebase using a Version Control System (e.g., Git).

#### 4.2. Automated Version Updates

TODO: Automated version updates for documentation are not specified in the provided context.

#### 4.3. Cross-Reference Maintenance

TODO: Cross-reference maintenance for documentation is not specified in the provided context.

#### 4.4. Dependency Management

TODO: Dependency management for documentation is not specified in the provided context.
