## Documentation Review and Approval Processes

This document outlines the comprehensive workflows and approval processes designed to ensure the highest quality and technical accuracy of all documentation.

### 1. Review Workflows

Documentation undergoes a structured review process to guarantee accuracy, clarity, and adherence to standards.

#### 1.1. Documentation Review Stages

The review process consists of the following stages:

1.  **Authoring:** The initial creation of documentation by the subject matter expert or technical writer.
2.  **Technical Review:** A peer review by subject matter experts or senior engineers to validate technical accuracy, completeness, and correctness.
3.  **Editorial Review:** A review by a dedicated editor or documentation specialist to ensure adherence to documentation standards.

TODO: Reviewer assignments and roles are not specified in the provided context.
TODO: Review criteria and checklists are not specified in the provided context.
TODO: Approval hierarchies are not specified in the provided context.

### 2. Review Standards

TODO: Specific review standards beyond general principles are not detailed in the provided context. However, general guidelines for documentation quality are available.

*   **Content Accuracy Requirements:** Documentation must be accurate and reflect the current state of the project.
*   **Technical Correctness Validation:** Technical details within the documentation must be validated for correctness.
*   **Style and Formatting Checks:** Documentation should adhere to established style and formatting guidelines.
*   **Accessibility Compliance:** Documentation must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

### 3. Feedback Management

TODO: Specific processes for feedback management, including comment handling, revision tracking, conflict resolution, and final approval criteria, are not detailed in the provided context.

### 4. Review Tools & Processes

TODO: Specific tools and processes for review, such as review platform usage, change tracking methods, and review timeline management, are not detailed in the provided context. However, the following are relevant:

*   **Documentation Versioning:** Documentation versions will align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer). Major documentation changes will correspond to major application version updates, and minor documentation updates will align with minor application version updates.
*   **Primary Tools:** Markdown is used for writing documentation, and a Version Control System (e.g., Git) is used for managing documentation alongside the codebase.
