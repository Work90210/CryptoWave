## Documentation Review and Approval Processes

This document outlines the comprehensive workflows and approval processes designed to ensure the highest quality and technical accuracy of all documentation.

### 1. Review Workflows

Documentation undergoes a structured review process to guarantee accuracy, clarity, and adherence to standards.

#### 1.1. Documentation Review Stages

The review process consists of the following stages:

1.  **Authoring:** The initial creation of documentation by the subject matter expert or technical writer.
2.  **Technical Review:** A peer review by subject matter experts or senior engineers to validate technical accuracy, completeness, and correctness.
3.  **Editorial Review:** A review by a dedicated editor or documentation specialist to ensure adherence to standards.

### 3. Feedback Management

### 4. Review Tools & Processes

*   **Documentation Versioning:** Documentation versions will align with the application's semantic versioning (SemVer) where applicable. Major documentation changes will correspond to major version updates of the application, and minor documentation updates will align with minor application version updates [S8].
*   **Review Platform Usage:** Documentation is managed and presented using Markdown, rendered through a static site generator or directly within version control platforms [S3]. Version control systems like Git are integral for managing documentation alongside the codebase, enabling version tracking, branching, and collaborative workflows [S3].

TODO: Review timeline management is not detailed in the provided context.
TODO: Change tracking methods are not detailed in the provided context.
