# CryptoWave: System Overview

CryptoWave is a Flutter application designed for real-time cryptocurrency price tracking, market data analysis, and trend visualization. It leverages the CoinGecko API to provide users with up-to-date information on a wide range of cryptocurrencies. The application aims to offer a reliable, accessible, and user-friendly platform for monitoring market trends and individual coin performance.

*   **Detailed Coin Information:** Offers comprehensive details about individual cryptocurrencies.

### Problem Domain and Solutions Provided:
