    *   The application provides global cryptocurrency market data.
    *   Data is presented in real-time, with historical data available for analysis.

### 2. System Boundaries

The CryptoWave application operates within clearly defined boundaries to ensure focused development and maintainability.

*   **Inclusion Criteria:**
    *   All functionalities directly related to fetching, processing, and displaying cryptocurrency market data from the CoinGecko API.
    *   User interface elements that facilitate the presentation and interaction with this data.
    *   State management using the Bloc pattern for efficient UI updates.
    *   Dependency injection using GetIt for service management.

*   **Exclusion Criteria:**
    *   Direct trading or transaction capabilities for cryptocurrencies.
    *   User account management or authentication features beyond basic application setup.
    *   News aggregation or sentiment analysis related to cryptocurrencies.
    *   Portfolio management features beyond simple price tracking.

*   **Interface Points with External Systems:**
    *   **CoinGecko API:** The primary external system for all cryptocurrency data. The application interacts with this API to retrieve market data, coin information, and historical charts.
    *   **Flutter Framework:** The core UI and application development framework.
    *   **Dart Ecosystem:** Libraries and packages used for state management, networking, and data serialization.

*   **Responsibility Boundaries:**
    *   The application is responsible for the presentation and user interaction with cryptocurrency market data.
    *   Data fetching, validation, and error handling are managed by dedicated repositories and services.
    *   The UI layer is responsible for rendering the data and capturing user input.

### 3. Out of Scope

Certain functionalities and related systems are explicitly excluded from the current scope of CryptoWave to maintain focus and manage complexity.

*   **Functionalities Explicitly Not Included:**
    *   Direct cryptocurrency trading or exchange functionalities.
    *   User registration, login, or profile management.
    *   Push notifications for price alerts or news.
    *   Advanced portfolio tracking with buy/sell order history.
    *   Integration with blockchain explorers or wallet services.
    *   Fiat currency conversion beyond what is provided by the CoinGecko API.

*   **Related Systems and Their Boundaries:**
    *   **Cryptocurrency Exchanges:** These are external entities that CryptoWave does not directly interact with for trading.
    *   **Blockchain Networks:** CryptoWave does not directly interact with any blockchain networks.
    *   **News Aggregators/Sentiment Analysis Platforms:** While related to cryptocurrency, these are not integrated into the current version of CryptoWave.

*   **Future Scope Considerations:**
    *   User watchlists and personalized alerts.
    *   Integration with additional data sources for broader market coverage.
    *   Enhanced portfolio tracking features.

*   **Alternative Solutions for Excluded Needs:**
    *   For cryptocurrency trading, users should refer to dedicated cryptocurrency exchange platforms.
    *   For detailed blockchain analysis, users should consult blockchain explorers.

### 4. Dependencies & Integrations

CryptoWave relies on specific external systems and libraries to function.

*   **Required External Systems:**
    *   **CoinGecko API:** Essential for all cryptocurrency data. The application's functionality is directly dependent on the availability and structure of this API.

*   **Optional Integrations:**
    *   **Flutter Environment:** The application requires a Flutter SDK for development and deployment.
    *   **Dart Packages:** Specific packages are utilized for state management (`flutter_bloc`), data serialization (`json_serializable`, `freezed`), dependency injection (`get_it`), and environment variable loading (`flutter_dotenv`).

*   **Data Exchange Boundaries:**
    *   Data is exchanged with the CoinGecko API via RESTful HTTP requests.
    *   The application primarily consumes JSON data from the API, which is then parsed into Dart objects using `json_serializable`.

*   **Service Level Dependencies:**
    *   The application's performance and data accuracy are directly dependent on the CoinGecko API's uptime, response times, and data integrity.

### 5. Constraints & Limitations

The CryptoWave application operates within several constraints and limitations.

*   **Technical Constraints:**
    *   **API Rate Limits:** Adherence to CoinGecko API rate limits is crucial to avoid service disruptions.
    *   **Flutter/Dart Version Compatibility:** The application is built using specific versions of Flutter and Dart, and compatibility with future versions is not guaranteed without testing.
    *   **Platform Dependencies:** The application relies on Flutter's cross-platform capabilities but may encounter platform-specific nuances during development or deployment.

*   **Business Rule Limitations:**
    *   The application strictly adheres to the data provided by the CoinGecko API. Any limitations or inaccuracies in the CoinGecko API's data will be reflected in the application.
    *   The application does not provide financial advice or investment recommendations.

*   **Performance Boundaries:**
    *   UI responsiveness is dependent on the efficiency of data fetching, processing, and rendering.
    *   The application aims for smooth performance on typical mobile devices, but performance may vary based on device capabilities and network conditions.

*   **Compliance Boundaries:**
    *   The application complies with standard data privacy practices. User data is not collected or stored beyond what is necessary for application functionality.
    *   All data displayed is sourced from the CoinGecko API, and the application adheres to their terms of service.
