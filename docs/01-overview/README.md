# Project Name: Tagging API

## Tagging API: Effortlessly manage and retrieve tags for your data.

The Tagging API provides a robust solution for associating, retrieving, and managing tags across various data entities. It simplifies the process of categorizing and organizing information, enabling more efficient data discovery and analysis.

### Key Features:

*   **Tag Creation:** Define and create new tags.
*   **Tag Association:** Link tags to specific data entities.
*   **Tag Retrieval:** Fetch entities based on associated tags.
*   **Tag Management:** Update and delete existing tags.

### Target Audience and Use Cases:

This API is designed for developers and data engineers who need to implement flexible tagging systems within their applications. Common use cases include:

*   Content management systems for categorizing articles or media.
*   E-commerce platforms for product tagging and filtering.
*   Data lakes for organizing and discovering datasets.
*   User profile management for tagging user interests.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites:

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` package installer

### Installation:

```bash
pip install tagging-api
```

### Basic Usage:

```python
from tagging_api.api import TaggingAPI

# Initialize the API
api = TaggingAPI()

# Create a tag
tag_id = api.create_tag("important")

# Associate the tag with an entity (e.g., an item with ID 'item-123')
api.associate_tag_with_entity(tag_id, "item-123")

# Retrieve entities with the 'important' tag
important_items = api.get_entities_by_tag("important")
print(important_items)
```

### First-Time Setup:

No specific first-time setup is required beyond installation. The API uses an in-memory store by default. For persistent storage, refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
