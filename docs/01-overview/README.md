# Project Name: Tagging Service

A service for managing and retrieving tags associated with various entities.

## 1. Project Introduction

The Tagging Service provides a robust and efficient way to associate descriptive tags with different entities within your system. This enables enhanced organization, searchability, and categorization of your data.

### Key Features and Capabilities

*   **Tag Creation and Management:** Create, update, and delete tags.
*   **Entity Tagging:** Associate multiple tags with specific entities.
*   **Tag Retrieval:** Fetch entities based on associated tags.
*   **Tag Autocompletion:** Suggest relevant tags during input.

### Target Audience and Use Cases

This service is designed for developers and system architects who need to implement flexible tagging mechanisms. Common use cases include:

*   Content management systems for categorizing articles or media.
*   E-commerce platforms for product tagging and filtering.
*   User profile management for interest-based tagging.

## 2. Quick Start

This section guides you through the initial setup and basic usage of the Tagging Service.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip

### Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from tagging_service.tagging_service import TaggingService

# Initialize the service
tagging_service = TaggingService()

# Create tags
tagging_service.create_tag("python")
tagging_service.create_tag("api")

# Tag an entity (e.g., an article with ID 'article-123')
tagging_service.tag_entity("article-123", ["python", "api"])

# Retrieve entities by tag
python_articles = tagging_service.get_entities_by_tag("python")
print(f"Articles tagged with 'python': {python_articles}")

api_articles = tagging_service.get_entities_by_tag("api")
print(f"Articles tagged with 'api': {api_articles}")
```

### First-Time Setup

No specific first-time setup is required beyond installation. The service manages its state internally.
