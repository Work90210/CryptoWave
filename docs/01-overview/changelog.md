TODO: The provided context does not contain sufficient information to generate a high-level system changelog covering version history, system evolution, business impact, migration guides, or future roadmap. The `README.md` files ([S1], [S24]) provide an overview of the project's features and tech stack, but lack version history or detailed change logs. The `analysis_options.yaml` ([S2]) and various Android manifest and resource files ([S3], [S4], [S5], [S6], [S7], [S8], [S9], [S10]) and Gradle configuration files ([S11], [S12], [S13]) detail technical configurations but do not offer historical change information. Documentation meta-files ([S16] through [S23]) outline documentation standards and processes but do not contain changelog content. The `assets/lottie/error.json` ([S14]) is a Lottie animation file.
