## CryptoWave Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get CryptoWave up and running in under 5 minutes.

### 1. Prerequisites Check

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Required Software:**
    *   Flutter SDK (version 3.x or later)
    *   Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
    *   An IDE with Flutter and Dart plugins (e.g., VS Code, Android Studio)
    *   A device or emulator capable of running Flutter applications (Android or iOS).

*   **Environment Requirements:**
    *   A stable internet connection to download dependencies and fetch API data.
    *   Sufficient disk space for the Flutter SDK and project dependencies.

*   **Access Permissions:**
    *   No special access permissions are required for initial setup. The application will request network access when it runs.

*   **Dependency Verification:**
    *   Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
    *   Run `flutter pub get` to ensure all project dependencies are downloaded and linked. This command is automatically executed by `flutter run` if dependencies are missing.

### 2. Fast Installation

Follow these steps for a rapid setup:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptowave.git
    cd cryptowave
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username or the repository owner's username.)*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    This command will build and launch the application on your connected device or emulator.

*   **Minimal Setup Commands:** The `git clone`, `cd`, `flutter pub get`, and `flutter run` commands are the only essential steps.
*   **Quick Configuration Options:** No immediate configuration is required. The application uses default settings and fetches data from the CoinGecko API.
*   **Default Settings:** The application defaults to fetching cryptocurrency data and displaying it in a user-friendly interface.
*   **Verification Steps:**
    *   Observe the application launching on your device/emulator.
    *   Verify that the main screen displays a list of cryptocurrencies.

### 3. First Success

Upon successful execution, you will see the CryptoWave application running.

*   **Simple Working Example:** The application will display a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices and market cap information.
*   **Expected Output/Results:**
    *   A list of cryptocurrencies populates the main screen.
    *   Each cryptocurrency entry shows its name, symbol, current price, and market cap.
    *   Tapping on a cryptocurrency navigates to its detailed view, displaying price charts and additional information.
*   **Common Success Indicators:**
    *   The Flutter splash screen appears and transitions smoothly to the main UI.
    *   A list of cryptocurrencies is visible and updates in near real-time.
    *   Navigation to coin details pages functions correctly.

### 4. Immediate Next Steps

*   **Detailed Setup:** For a comprehensive understanding of the project structure, state management (Bloc pattern), and API integration, refer to the [full documentation](link-to-full-documentation). *(Note: Replace `link-to-full-documentation` with the actual link if available.)*
*   **Customization Options:**
    *   **API Key:** If you intend to use a different API or a private instance, you may need to configure API keys. Refer to the `lib/constants.dart` file for API-related constants.
    *   **Theming:** Explore `lib/ui/theme/app_theme.dart` for UI customization options.
*   **Troubleshooting Quick Fixes:**
    *   **`flutter run` fails:** Ensure your Flutter SDK is correctly installed and in your PATH. Run `flutter doctor` to diagnose environment issues.
    *   **No internet connection:** Verify your device or emulator has internet access. The CoinGecko API requires a stable connection.
    *   **Dependency issues:** If you encounter errors related to packages, try deleting the `pubspec.lock` file and running `flutter pub get` again.

### 5. Common Issues

*   **Issue:** `flutter run` command not found.
    *   **Resolution:** Ensure the Flutter SDK is correctly installed and its `bin` directory is added to your system's PATH environment variable. Restart your IDE or terminal after updating the PATH.
*   **Issue:** Network errors or inability to fetch data.
    *   **Resolution:** Confirm your device or emulator has an active internet connection. Check if any firewalls or network restrictions are blocking access to the CoinGecko API endpoints.
*   **Issue:** Build errors or dependency conflicts.
    *   **Resolution:** Clean the project by running `flutter clean`, then delete the `pubspec.lock` file, and finally run `flutter pub get` followed by `flutter run`.
*   **When to Seek Help:** If you encounter persistent issues not covered here, consult the project's issue tracker or community forums for support.
