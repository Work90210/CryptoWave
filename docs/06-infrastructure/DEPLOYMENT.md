# CryptoWave Deployment Documentation

This document outlines the procedures and considerations for deploying the CryptoWave application. It covers environment setup, build processes, configuration, infrastructure, CI/CD, and operational aspects.

## 1. Environment Setup and Prerequisites

To deploy CryptoWave, the following environments and prerequisites must be met:

*   **Development Environment:**
    *   **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or Windows.
    *   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or higher is required for Android development.
    *   **Android SDK:** Installed and configured.
    *   **Flutter SDK:** Installed and configured. The `flutter doctor` command should report no critical issues.
    *   **IDE:** Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter and Dart plugins.
    *   **Version Control:** Git installed and configured.
*   **Build Environment:**
    *   A machine capable of compiling Flutter applications for Android.
    *   Access to necessary signing keys for Android app releases.
*   **Production Environment:**
    *   Cloud hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
    *   Container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) if containerization is used.
    *   Database services.
    *   Networking and security configurations (firewalls, load balancers).

## 2. Build Process and Dependencies

CryptoWave is a Flutter application. The build process leverages the Flutter SDK and Gradle for Android.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Flutter SDK: Manages Dart and Flutter framework dependencies.
    *   Gradle: Manages Android-specific dependencies and build tasks.
    *   `pubspec.yaml`: Lists Dart package dependencies.
*   **Build Commands:**
    *   **For Android Release Build:**
        ```bash
        flutter build apk --release
        # or for app bundle
        flutter build appbundle --release
        ```
    *   **For Debug Build:**
        ```bash
        flutter build apk --debug
        ```
*   **Output:** The build process generates `.apk` or `.aab` files in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory for Android.

## 3. Configuration Management

Application configuration is managed through various mechanisms:

*   **`android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml` and `android/app/src/main/res/values-night/styles.xml`:** These files define Android-specific styling and theming.
*   **`android/gradle.properties`:** Contains Gradle-specific properties, potentially including build-time configurations.
*   **`android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:** Configures the Gradle wrapper, specifying the Gradle version used for the build.
*   **Environment Variables:** Application settings can be injected via environment variables during runtime, especially in containerized or cloud environments. Specific variables are detailed in Section 4.

## 4. Environment Variables and Secrets

Sensitive information and environment-specific configurations should be managed via environment variables.

*   **Key Variables (Examples - specific variables to be defined based on application needs):**
    *   `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for backend API calls.
    *   `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase API key for authentication and other services.
    *   `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Stripe publishable key for payment processing.
    *   `APP_ENV`: Specifies the deployment environment (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`).
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   For production deployments, secrets should be managed securely using a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault) or through secure environment variable injection mechanisms provided by the deployment platform.
    *   **DO NOT** commit secrets directly into the codebase.

## 5. Containerization

While the provided files do not explicitly include Dockerfiles, containerization is a common deployment pattern for Flutter applications.

*   **Dockerfile (Example - to be created):**
    A `Dockerfile` would be created in the root of the repository to define the build and runtime environment for a Docker image. This would typically involve:
    1.  Using a Flutter SDK base image.
    2.  Copying the project files.
    3.  Running `flutter build apk` or `flutter build appbundle`.
    4.  Setting up a minimal runtime environment (e.g., using a lightweight Android emulator or a custom runtime).
    5.  Exposing necessary ports.
*   **Container Orchestration:** If containerized, Kubernetes or Docker Swarm would be used to manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of the application containers.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

To ensure reproducible and manageable infrastructure, IaC tools are recommended.

*   **Tools:** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi, or Ansible can be used.
*   **Configuration:** IaC scripts would define and provision all necessary cloud resources, including virtual machines, databases, load balancers, and networking components.
*   **Version Control:** IaC scripts should be stored in version control alongside the application code.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process.

*   **Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI.
*   **Pipeline Stages:**
    1.  **Checkout:** Fetch the latest code from the repository.
    2.  **Setup:** Set up the Flutter SDK and any necessary build tools.
    3.  **Linting & Analysis:** Run `flutter analyze` and `dart analyze` using `analysis_options.yaml` and `devtools_options.yaml`.
    4.  **Testing:** Execute unit and widget tests (`flutter test`).
    5.  **Build:** Create release builds (`flutter build apk --release` or `flutter build appbundle --release`).
    6.  **Artifact Storage:** Store build artifacts (e.g., `.apk`, `.aab`) in a repository like Nexus, Artifactory, or cloud storage.
    7.  **Deployment:** Deploy the artifacts to the target environment (Dev, Staging, Prod).
    8.  **Notifications:** Send notifications on pipeline success or failure.
*   **Configuration Files:** CI/CD pipeline configurations would typically be defined in YAML files within the repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/` for GitHub Actions).

## 8. Deployment Strategies

Various strategies can be employed for deploying CryptoWave:

*   **Blue-Green Deployment:** Maintain two identical production environments (Blue and Green). Deploy the new version to the inactive environment (Green), test it, and then switch traffic from Blue to Green.
*   **Canary Releases:** Gradually roll out the new version to a small subset of users. Monitor performance and stability, then incrementally increase the rollout percentage.
*   **Rolling Updates:** Update instances of the application one by one or in batches, ensuring that a certain number of instances are always available.

## 9. Environment Promotion (Dev → Staging → Prod)

A structured approach to promoting builds through different environments is crucial.

1.  **Development (Dev):**
    *   Builds are triggered by feature branch commits or pull requests.
    *   Automated tests are run.
    *   Deployment to a development environment for initial testing by developers.
2.  **Staging:**
    *   Builds are promoted from Dev or triggered by merges to a staging branch.
    *   More comprehensive testing, including integration and end-to-end tests.
    *   Deployment to a staging environment that closely mirrors production.
    *   User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by QA or stakeholders.
3.  **Production (Prod):**
    *   Builds are promoted from Staging after successful UAT.
    *   Deployment to the production environment using a chosen deployment strategy (e.g., Blue-Green, Canary).
    *   Post-deployment monitoring and validation.

## 10. Monitoring and Health Checks

Robust monitoring and health checks are essential for ensuring application availability and performance.

*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Tools like Firebase Performance Monitoring, Sentry, or Datadog can track app performance, errors, and crashes.
*   **Logging:** Centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs) should be used to aggregate logs from all application instances.
*   **Health Check Endpoints:** Implement specific API endpoints (e.g., `/health`) that return the status of the application and its dependencies. Load balancers and orchestration platforms can use these endpoints to determine instance health.
*   **Metrics:** Collect and monitor key metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, request latency, and error rates.

## 11. Rollback Procedures

A well-defined rollback procedure is critical for quickly reverting to a stable version in case of deployment failures.

1.  **Identify Failure:** Monitor the deployment process and application health post-deployment.
2.  **Initiate Rollback:** Trigger the rollback mechanism in the CI/CD pipeline or orchestration platform.
3.  **Revert Code/Artifacts:** Deploy the previously known good version of the application.
4.  **Verify Rollback:** Confirm that the application is functioning correctly after the rollback.
5.  **Investigate Root Cause:** Analyze the cause of the failure to prevent recurrence.

## 12. Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery (DR) plans ensure business continuity in the event of a catastrophic failure.

*   **Data Backups:** Regularly back up all critical data (e.g., databases, user files).
*   **Redundancy:** Deploy the application across multiple availability zones or regions to ensure high availability.
*   **Failover Mechanisms:** Implement automated failover to standby systems in case of primary system failure.
*   **DR Drills:** Periodically test the DR plan to ensure its effectiveness.

## 13. Performance Optimization for Production

Several optimizations should be considered for production deployments:

*   **Code Optimization:** Ensure efficient algorithms and data structures are used.
*   **Asset Optimization:** Compress images and other assets.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
*   **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries and schema.
*   **CDN Usage:** Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for serving static assets.
*   **Release Mode Builds:** Always deploy release builds (`flutter build apk --release` or `flutter build appbundle --release`) which are optimized for performance.

## 14. Security Considerations in Deployment

Security must be a primary concern throughout the deployment lifecycle.

*   **Secure Signing Keys:** Protect Android signing keys with strong passwords and store them securely.
*   **Environment Hardening:** Secure the underlying infrastructure by applying security patches, configuring firewalls, and disabling unnecessary services.
*   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control policies for all deployment environments and infrastructure.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the application and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities.
*   **HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with the backend is over HTTPS.
*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## 15. Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

*   **Build Failures:**
    *   **Cause:** Missing dependencies, incorrect SDK versions, environment misconfigurations.
    *   **Solution:** Verify `flutter doctor` output, check `android/gradle.properties` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`, ensure correct JDK is set.
*   **Runtime Crashes:**
    *   **Cause:** Unhandled exceptions, memory leaks, incorrect environment variable configurations.
    *   **Solution:** Review application logs, use debugging tools, ensure all required environment variables are correctly set.
*   **Network Issues:**
    *   **Cause:** Firewall misconfigurations, incorrect API endpoints, DNS issues.
    *   **Solution:** Verify network connectivity, check firewall rules, confirm `API_BASE_URL` and other network-related configurations.
*   **Performance Degradation:**
    *   **Cause:** Inefficient code, resource contention, unoptimized database queries.
    *   **Solution:** Profile the application, analyze performance metrics, optimize critical code paths and database operations.
*   **Signing Errors:**
    *   **Cause:** Incorrect keystore path, wrong password, mismatch between signing certificate and app store account.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check signing configurations in `android/app/build.gradle` (not provided in the file list, but a common location), ensure keystore is accessible and credentials are correct.
