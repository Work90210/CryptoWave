# CryptoWave Deployment Documentation

This document outlines the procedures and considerations for deploying the CryptoWave application.

## 1. Environment Setup and Prerequisites

To deploy CryptoWave, the following environments and prerequisites must be met:

*   **Development Environment:**
    *   **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or Windows.
    *   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or higher is required for Android development.
    *   **Android SDK:** Installed and configured.
    *   **Flutter SDK:** Installed and configured. The `flutter doctor` command should report no critical issues.
    *   **IDE:** Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter and Dart extensions.
    *   **Version Control:** Git installed and configured.
*   **Build Environment:**
    *   A machine capable of building Flutter applications for Android.
    *   Access to signing keys for Android application distribution.
*   **Production Environment:**
    *   Cloud hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
    *   Container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) if containerization is used.
    *   Database services.
    *   Networking and load balancing configurations.

## 2. Build Process and Dependencies

CryptoWave is a Flutter application. The build process leverages the Flutter SDK and Gradle for Android builds.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Flutter SDK: Manages Dart and Flutter package dependencies.
    *   Gradle: Manages Android-specific dependencies and build tasks.
*   **Build Commands:**
    *   **Debug Build:** `flutter build apk --debug`
    *   **Profile Build:** `flutter build apk --profile`
    *   **Release Build:** `flutter build apk --release`
    *   **App Bundle (for Play Store):** `flutter build appbundle --release`

The `android/gradle.properties` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` files configure Gradle settings, including the Gradle version and distribution.

## 3. Configuration Management

Application configuration is managed through:

*   **`android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml` and `android/app/src/main/res/values-night/styles.xml`:** These files define Android application themes and styles.
*   **`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:** This file contains essential application metadata, permissions, and activity declarations.
*   **Environment-specific configurations:** For different deployment environments (development, staging, production), configuration values (e.g., API endpoints, feature flags) should be managed externally. This can be achieved through:
    *   Build flavors in Flutter.
    *   Environment variables injected during the build or runtime.
    *   Configuration files that are conditionally loaded.

## 4. Environment Variables and Secrets

Sensitive information and environment-specific settings should not be hardcoded.

*   **Flutter `.env` files:** While not explicitly present in the provided file list, a common practice is to use `.env` files for managing environment variables. These files should be added to `.gitignore`.
*   **Android `local.properties`:** This file is typically used for local development environment settings (e.g., SDK paths) and should not be committed to version control.
*   **Secrets Management:** For production environments, secrets (API keys, database credentials) should be managed using a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets). These secrets are then injected into the application at runtime or build time.

## 5. Containerization

The provided file structure does not explicitly include Dockerfiles or containerization configurations. If containerization is adopted, Dockerfiles would need to be created to package the Flutter application for deployment.

*   **TODO:** Document Dockerfile creation and configuration if containerization is implemented.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code

The repository does not contain Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).

*   **TODO:** Document IaC practices and tools used for provisioning and managing deployment infrastructure.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

The repository includes `analysis_options.yaml` and `devtools_options.yaml`, which are used for code analysis and development tooling, respectively. These files can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated checks.

*   **CI/CD Tools:** Common tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI can be used.
*   **Pipeline Stages:**
    1.  **Checkout:** Fetch the latest code from the repository.
    2.  **Dependencies:** Install Flutter SDK and project dependencies (`flutter pub get`).
    3.  **Linting/Analysis:** Run static analysis using `flutter analyze` and potentially custom rules defined in `analysis_options.yaml`.
    4.  **Testing:** Execute unit and widget tests (`flutter test`).
    5.  **Build:** Create release builds (APK or App Bundle) using `flutter build apk --release` or `flutter build appbundle --release`.
    6.  **Artifact Storage:** Store build artifacts in a repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory, cloud storage).
    7.  **Deployment:** Deploy the artifacts to the target environment.

*   **TODO:** Provide specific CI/CD pipeline configurations for chosen tools (e.g., `.github/workflows/` for GitHub Actions).

## 8. Deployment Strategies

Common deployment strategies include:

*   **Direct Deployment:** Deploying the built APK or App Bundle directly to app stores or distribution platforms.
*   **Canary Releases:** Releasing a new version to a small subset of users before a full rollout.
*   **Blue-Green Deployments:** Running two identical production environments, switching traffic from the old to the new one.
*   **Rolling Updates:** Gradually replacing instances of the old version with the new version.

The choice of strategy depends on the target platform (e.g., Google Play Store, internal distribution) and infrastructure.

## 9. Environment Promotion (Dev → Staging → Prod)

A typical promotion workflow involves:

1.  **Development:** Developers work on features and bug fixes in their local environments. Code is committed to feature branches.
2.  **Integration/Staging:** Code from feature branches is merged into a staging branch. Automated tests and builds are triggered. The application is deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production. This environment is used for QA testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).
3.  **Production:** Once the staging environment is validated, the code is merged into the main/production branch. A release build is created and deployed to the production environment.

*   **Branching Strategy:** A Git branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) should be followed to manage releases and promotions.
*   **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive automated tests are crucial at each stage to ensure stability.

## 10. Monitoring and Health Checks

*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Integrate APM tools (e.g., Firebase Performance Monitoring, Sentry, Datadog) to track application performance, errors, and crashes.
*   **Logging:** Implement robust logging within the application to capture events, errors, and user activity. Logs should be aggregated and analyzed using a centralized logging system.
*   **Health Checks:** Implement API endpoints or mechanisms within the application that can be polled by monitoring systems to verify the application's health and responsiveness. For a mobile app, this might involve checking connectivity to backend services.

## 11. Rollback Procedures

In case of critical issues in production, a rollback procedure must be in place:

1.  **Identify the issue:** Determine the cause of the failure.
2.  **Initiate rollback:** Deploy the previous stable version of the application.
3.  **Communicate:** Inform stakeholders about the rollback and the ongoing investigation.
4.  **Investigate and fix:** Analyze the problematic version to identify and fix the root cause.
5.  **Re-deploy:** Once the fix is verified, re-deploy the corrected version.

The ability to quickly revert to a known good state is essential. This often involves maintaining previous build artifacts and having automated rollback scripts.

## 12. Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery (DR) planning ensures business continuity in the event of a catastrophic failure.

*   **Data Backups:** Regularly back up all critical data (e.g., user data, application state).
*   **Redundancy:** Deploy the application across multiple availability zones or regions to mitigate the impact of localized failures.
*   **Failover Mechanisms:** Implement automated failover to backup systems or redundant infrastructure.
*   **DR Plan:** Maintain a documented DR plan that outlines procedures for recovery, including RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).

## 13. Performance Optimization for Production

*   **Code Optimization:** Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical code paths.
*   **Asset Optimization:** Compress images, use efficient animation formats (like Lottie JSON files, e.g., `assets/lottie/error.json`), and minimize asset sizes.
*   **Network Requests:** Optimize network calls, reduce payload sizes, and implement caching strategies.
*   **Release Builds:** Always deploy release builds (`flutter build apk --release` or `flutter build appbundle --release`) which are optimized for performance and size.
*   **ProGuard/R8:** Ensure ProGuard or R8 is enabled for release builds to obfuscate and shrink the Android code.

## 14. Security Considerations in Deployment

*   **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS for all network communication.
*   **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode sensitive information. Use secure secrets management solutions.
*   **Code Obfuscation:** Use ProGuard/R8 for Android release builds to make reverse engineering more difficult.
*   **Permissions:** Request only necessary Android permissions as defined in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **App Signing:** Securely manage app signing keys.

## 15. Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

*   **Build Failures:**
    *   **Cause:** Missing dependencies, incorrect SDK versions, environment misconfigurations.
    *   **Solution:** Run `flutter doctor`, check `gradle.properties`, ensure correct JDK and Android SDK paths are set.
*   **Runtime Crashes:**
    *   **Cause:** Unhandled exceptions, memory leaks, platform-specific issues.
    *   **Solution:** Analyze crash reports from APM tools, review logs, reproduce the issue in a debug environment.
*   **Performance Degradation:**
    *   **Cause:** Inefficient code, excessive network requests, large assets.
    *   **Solution:** Use profiling tools, optimize code and assets, implement caching.
*   **Configuration Errors:**
    *   **Cause:** Incorrect environment variables, missing configuration files.
    *   **Solution:** Verify environment variable injection, ensure configuration files are correctly placed and loaded.
