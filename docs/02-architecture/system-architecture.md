# CryptoWave: System Architecture Documentation

## 1. System Overview

CryptoWave is a Flutter application designed for real-time cryptocurrency price tracking and market data analysis. It leverages the CoinGecko API to provide users with up-to-date information on various cryptocurrencies, including price charts, historical data, and detailed coin metrics. The application employs the Bloc pattern for state management, ensuring a predictable and maintainable UI.

## 2. Architecture Patterns Used

The CryptoWave application adheres to a **Component-Based Architecture**. This pattern is evident in the modular structure of the UI, where distinct features and functionalities are encapsulated within reusable components. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability.

## 4. Data Flow and Dependencies

The application follows a layered architecture:

1.  **UI Layer**: Components in the `ui/` directory are responsible for rendering the user interface and capturing user input. They interact with the BLoC layer for state management.
2.  **Bloc Layer**: The `flutter_bloc` package is used for state management. BLoCs (Business Logic Components) handle user events, interact with repositories, and emit states that update the UI.
3.  **Repository Layer**: Repositories (`repositories/`) abstract data sources. They fetch data from APIs (e.g., CoinGecko API via `http_client.dart`) and handle data transformations.
4.  **Data Layer**: Models (`models/`) define the structure of data fetched from APIs, often generated using `freezed` and `json_serializable`.
5.  **Network Layer**: Handles all network communication, including HTTP requests and exception management (`network/`).
6.  **Utility Layer**: Contains helper classes and functions for common tasks, such as `constants.dart` for API URLs and `logger_service.dart` for logging.

**Key Relationships:**

*   `lib/main.dart` imports and uses `home.dart` and `service_locator.dart`.
*   `lib/models/coin/coin_model.dart` is used by `lib/repositories/coin_repository.dart`.
*   `lib/repositories/coin_repository.dart` imports and uses `lib/network/http_client.dart` and `lib/network/network_response.dart`.
*   `lib/ui/coin_details/coin_details.dart` depends on `lib/models/coin/coin_model.dart` and `lib/ui/coin_details/cubit/coin_details_cubit.dart`.

## 5. Design Decisions and Rationale

*   **Bloc Pattern**: Chosen for state management to ensure a clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic, leading to more predictable and testable code.
*   **Freezed and JsonSerializable**: Utilized for generating immutable data models and efficient JSON serialization/deserialization, reducing boilerplate code and improving type safety.
*   **CoinGecko API**: Selected as the primary data source due to its comprehensive and reliable cryptocurrency market data.
*   **Modular File Structure**: The project is organized into logical directories (e.g., `models`, `repositories`, `ui`) to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## 6. Scalability Considerations

The application's architecture, particularly the separation of concerns through the Bloc pattern and repository pattern, facilitates scalability. New features or data sources can be integrated by adding new BLoCs, repositories, and UI components without significantly impacting existing code. The use of code generation for models also aids in managing larger datasets.

## 7. Security Architecture

*   **API Key Management**: While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets, secure handling of API keys (e.g., using environment variables via `flutter_dotenv`) is crucial for protecting sensitive credentials.
*   **Data Protection**: Data transmitted between the app and the CoinGecko API is secured via HTTPS.

## 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Efficient Data Handling**: The use of `freezed` for immutable models and `json_serializable` for efficient data parsing contributes to performance.
*   **State Management**: The Bloc pattern helps manage UI state efficiently, preventing unnecessary rebuilds.
*   **Caching**: No explicit caching mechanisms are detailed in the provided snippets, but implementing caching for API responses could further enhance performance by reducing network requests.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

The application is built using Flutter, allowing for cross-platform deployment to iOS and Android. The build process relies on Gradle for Android and Xcode build settings for iOS, as indicated by the presence of `android/` and `ios/` directories.

## 10. Future Architecture Improvements

*   **Caching**: Implement a local caching strategy for API responses to improve performance and offline capabilities.
*   **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide more specific user feedback for various network and API errors.
*   **Testing**: Expand unit and widget test coverage to ensure application stability and robustness.

## 11. Technology Stack Rationale

*   **Flutter**: Chosen for its ability to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, enabling faster development and consistent UI across platforms.
*   **Dart**: The programming language for Flutter, offering strong typing, ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, and a rich set of libraries.
*   **Bloc Pattern**: Provides a robust and scalable solution for state management in Flutter applications, promoting testability and maintainability.
*   **CoinGecko API**: A widely used and reliable API for accessing cryptocurrency market data, offering a comprehensive set of endpoints for price tracking and analysis.
*   **Freezed**: A code generation library for Dart that simplifies the creation of immutable classes, unions, and sealed classes, enhancing code safety and reducing boilerplate.
*   **JsonSerializable**: Used in conjunction with Freezed for automatic JSON serialization and deserialization, streamlining data handling.
*   **GetIt**: A service locator package used for dependency injection, facilitating the management and retrieval of services throughout the application.

## 12. Integration Points

*   **CoinGecko API**: The primary external integration point for fetching cryptocurrency data. The `lib/constants.dart` file defines the base URL for this API.
*   **Flutter Packages**: The application relies on various Flutter packages for UI, state management, networking, and code generation, as indicated by the `import` statements and `pubspec.yaml` (though not provided in the snippet).
