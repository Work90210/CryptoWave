# CryptoWave: System Architecture Documentation

## 1. System Overview

CryptoWave is a Flutter application that provides real-time cryptocurrency market data, price charts, and detailed coin information. The application leverages the CoinGecko API to fetch and process this data. Its core functionality revolves around displaying up-to-date financial information to users. [S7, S19]

## 2. Architecture Patterns Used

The CryptoWave application employs a **Component-Based Architecture**. This pattern is evident in the modular structure of the UI, where distinct features and functionalities are encapsulated within reusable components. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability. [S18]

## 3. Component Breakdown

The application's structure includes various directories and files that define its functionality:

*   **`docs/`**: Contains documentation for the project, including API documentation, architecture overviews, and meta-information. [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S16, S20]
*   **`lib/`**: Houses the core application code.
    *   **`lib/main.dart`**: The entry point of the Flutter application, extending `StatelessWidget`. [S21]
    *   **`lib/models/`**: Contains data models for representing cryptocurrency information.
        *   **`lib/models/coin/coin_model.freezed.dart`**: Defines the `CoinModel` which extends `CoinModel.dart` and implements `RoiModel.dart`. [S21]
        *   **`lib/models/coin_details/crypto_chart_data_model/crypto_chart_data_model.freezed.dart`**: Defines `CryptoChartDataModel` which implements `CryptoChartDataModel.dart` and `DataPointModel.dart`. [S21]
    *   **`lib/network/`**: Contains classes related to network operations and API interactions.
        *   **`lib/network/exception_handler.dart`**: Implements `Exception.dart` and extends `ApiException.dart`. This class is responsible for processing and standardizing API exceptions. [S6, S9, S11, S21]
        *   **`lib/network/http_client.dart`**: Imports `dart:async` and `dart:convert` for HTTP client functionalities. [S21]
    *   **`lib/repositories/`**: Contains repository classes that abstract API calls.
        *   **`lib/repositories/coin_repository.dart`**: Responsible for fetching cryptocurrency data. [S1, S2, S4, S5, S10, S12, S13, S14]
*   **`android/`**: Contains Android-specific project files.
    *   **`android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/cryptowave/MainActivity.kt`**: The main activity for the Android application. [S21]
*   **`assets/`**: Stores static assets used by the application.
    *   **`assets/lottie/error.json`**: A JSON file for Lottie animations, likely for error states. [S21]
*   **`analysis_options.yaml`**: Configuration file for the Dart analyzer, including linting rules. [S17]
*   **`pubspec.yaml`**: Defines project dependencies and metadata. [S21]
*   **`test/`**: Contains unit and integration tests for the application. [S21]

## 4. Data Flow and Dependencies

The application's data flow primarily involves fetching data from the CoinGecko API through repository classes. The `lib/repositories/coin_repository.dart` is a key component for these interactions. [S1, S2, S4, S5, S10, S12, S13, S14] The `ExceptionHandler` class in `lib/network/exception_handler.dart` plays a crucial role in processing and standardizing API exceptions. [S6, S9, S11]

Key relationships identified in the codebase include:
*   `lib/main.dart` extends `StatelessWidget`. [S21]
*   `lib/models/coin/coin_model.freezed.dart` extends `CoinModel.dart` and implements `RoiModel.dart`. [S21]
*   `lib/models/coin_details/crypto_chart_data_model/crypto_chart_data_model.freezed.dart` implements `CryptoChartDataModel.dart` and `DataPointModel.dart`. [S21]
*   `lib/network/exception_handler.dart` implements `Exception.dart` and extends `ApiException.dart`. [S21]
*   `lib/network/http_client.dart` imports `dart:async` and `dart:convert`. [S21]

## 5. Design Decisions and Rationale

The application utilizes a **repository pattern** to abstract direct API interactions, ensuring efficient and organized access to data. [S15, S14] The use of `freezed` for model generation suggests a focus on immutability and type safety. [S21] The `ExceptionHandler` class indicates a deliberate approach to managing and standardizing API errors. [S6, S9, S11]

## 6. Scalability Considerations

## 7. Security Architecture

### Authentication

The CryptoWave API does not require explicit authentication. All data is publicly accessible through the CoinGecko API. [S1, S5, S6, S7, S10, S12, S13] Interactions with the CoinGecko API are assumed to be unauthenticated. [S2, S3, S4, S8, S11, S14]

### Authorization

TODO: Information regarding authorization is not available in the provided context.

### Data Protection

## 9. Deployment Architecture

## 11. Technology Stack Rationale

The application leverages the **CoinGecko API** for real-time cryptocurrency market data. [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S19] This choice is driven by CoinGecko's provision of comprehensive and up-to-date financial information. The use of **Flutter** as the development framework enables cross-platform compatibility. [S18, S19] The **Bloc pattern** is used for state management, ensuring a predictable and maintainable UI. [S18]

## 12. Integration Points

The primary integration point is with the **CoinGecko API** for fetching cryptocurrency market data. [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S19]
