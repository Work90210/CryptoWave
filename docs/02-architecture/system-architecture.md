## 1. System Overview

CryptoWave is a project developed using a variety of languages including Markdown, YAML, XML, Kotlin, Properties, JSON, Swift, and Dart. The project structure indicates a multi-platform or multi-technology approach, with distinct directories for `android` and `ios`. The presence of `pubspec.yaml` suggests a Flutter or Dart-based component, while `MainActivity.kt` points to native Android development. The `assets` directory contains JSON files, likely for UI elements or data. The `docs` directory houses extensive documentation, covering aspects like accessibility, maintenance, metrics, review processes, standards, templates, tools, and versioning.

## 2. Architecture Patterns Used

The codebase exhibits the following architectural patterns:

*   **Modular Architecture:** The project is organized into feature-based modules, with identified components such as `04-apis`, `rest-api`, and `common`. This modularity promotes separation of concerns and maintainability.
*   **API Layer:** The presence of `04-apis` and `rest-api` suggests an API layer, likely implementing RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for data communication.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The modular structure implies the use of reusable UI components, a hallmark of component-based architectures.
*   **Database Layer:** The mention of a "Database Layer" in the detected patterns indicates data persistence and management are integral to the system.
*   **Authentication System:** The detection of an "Authentication System" points to user authentication and authorization mechanisms being in place.

## 3. Component Breakdown

The project is structured into several key directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

*   **`android/`**: Contains native Android project files.
    *   `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`: Debug-specific Android manifest.
    *   `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`: Main Android manifest file.
    *   `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/cryptowave/MainActivity.kt`: The main activity for the Android application, written in Kotlin.
    *   `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-v21/launch_background.xml`: Launch background for API 21+.
    *   `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml`: Default launch background.
    *   `android/app/src/main/res/values-night/styles.xml`: Styles for night mode.
    *   `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`: Application styles.
    *   `android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml`: Profile-specific Android manifest.
    *   `android/gradle.properties`: Gradle properties for the Android project.
    *   `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`: Gradle wrapper properties.
    *   `android/settings.gradle.kts`: Gradle settings file, written in Kotlin Script.
*   **`assets/`**: Stores static assets.
    *   `assets/lottie/error.json`: A JSON file, likely for Lottie animations, specifically an error animation.
*   **`docs/`**: Contains project documentation.
    *   `docs/00-meta/`: Meta-documentation files.
        *   `doc-accessibility.md`, `doc-maintenance.md`, `doc-metrics.md`, `doc-review-process.md`, `doc-standards.md`, `doc-templates.md`, `doc-tools.md`, `doc-versioning.md`: Markdown files detailing documentation standards and processes.
    *   `docs/01-overview/`: Overview documentation.
        *   `README.md`: General overview of the documentation.
        *   `business-context.md`: Information regarding the business context of the project.
*   **`lib/`**: Contains the core application logic, likely for Flutter/Dart.
*   **`pubspec.yaml`**: Project's dependency management file for Dart/Flutter projects.
*   **`README.md`**: The main README file for the repository.
*   **`analysis_options.yaml`**: Configuration for Dart static analysis.
*   **`devtools_options.yaml`**: Configuration for Dart DevTools.

## 4. Data Flow and Dependencies

The provided analysis indicates a modular architecture with components like `04-apis`, `rest-api`, and `common`. The system has 91 total files and 3 identified components. However, the analysis reports 0 relationships, 0 exported functions, and 0 exported classes. This suggests that while the modular structure is present, the explicit dependency and data flow information is not detailed in the provided snippets.

*   **TODO**: Further analysis is required to map the relationships between components (`04-apis`, `rest-api`, `common`) and understand the data flow.

## 5. Design Decisions and Rationale

The detected architectural patterns (Modular Architecture, API Layer, Component-Based Architecture, Database Layer, Authentication System) suggest a design focused on maintainability, reusability, and structured data handling. The use of a modular approach with components like `04-apis` and `rest-api` points to a deliberate effort to separate concerns, likely for easier development and scaling of specific features. The presence of extensive documentation in the `docs` directory indicates a strong emphasis on knowledge sharing and maintaining project health.

## 6. Scalability Considerations

The modular architecture, with its feature-based organization, provides a foundation for scalability. By isolating functionalities into distinct components, individual modules can be scaled independently as needed. The presence of an API layer suggests that the system is designed to handle external requests, which is crucial for scaling user-facing features.

*   **TODO**: Specific strategies for horizontal or vertical scaling, load balancing, and resource management are not detailed in the provided analysis.

## 7. Security Architecture

The detection of an "Authentication System" indicates that user authentication and authorization are implemented. This likely involves mechanisms to verify user identities and control access to resources.

*   **TODO**: Details regarding specific authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth, JWT), authorization models, data encryption (at rest and in transit), and vulnerability management are not provided.

## 8. Performance Considerations

The project utilizes `analysis_options.yaml` and `devtools_options.yaml`, which are tools for code analysis and development tooling, respectively. These can be leveraged for performance monitoring and optimization. The `assets` directory containing JSON files might be used for efficient data loading or UI rendering.

*   **TODO**: Information on caching strategies, performance optimization techniques (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading), and monitoring tools is not available.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

The project includes specific configurations for Android (`android/` directory) and potentially iOS (`ios/` directory). The `gradle.properties` and `settings.gradle.kts` files in the `android` directory are key for Android build and environment setup.

*   **TODO**: Details on the deployment infrastructure (e.g., cloud providers, CI/CD pipelines), environment setup (development, staging, production), and containerization are not provided.

## 10. Future Architecture Improvements

*   **TODO**: Specific recommendations for future architectural improvements are not present in the provided analysis.

## 11. Technology Stack Rationale

The technology stack includes:

*   **Languages:** Markdown, YAML, XML, Kotlin, Properties, JSON, Swift, Dart.
*   **Framework:** Next.js (as stated in the provided analysis, though not explicitly confirmed by file paths).

The rationale for choosing these technologies is not detailed. However, the combination of Kotlin and Swift suggests native mobile development capabilities for Android and iOS, respectively. Dart (implied by `pubspec.yaml`) is commonly used with the Flutter framework for cross-platform UI development. Next.js is a popular React framework for building web applications.

*   **TODO**: The specific rationale behind the selection of each technology in the stack needs to be documented.

## 12. Integration Points

The project structure suggests potential integration points:

*   **API Layer:** The `04-apis` and `rest-api` components indicate that the system is designed to interact with external services or provide an API for other clients.
*   **Native Mobile Integrations:** The `android/` directory with Kotlin files points to integration with native Android functionalities. Similarly, the presence of Swift implies potential iOS native integrations.
*   **Third-Party Tools:** The `devtools_options.yaml` file suggests integration with Dart DevTools.

*   **TODO**: Specific external APIs, third-party services, or SDKs that the system integrates with are not detailed.
