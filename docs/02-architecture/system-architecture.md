# CryptoWave System Architecture Documentation

## 1. System Overview

CryptoWave is a Flutter application designed for real-time cryptocurrency price tracking and market data analysis. It leverages the CoinGecko API to provide users with up-to-date information on various cryptocurrencies, including price charts, historical data, and detailed coin metrics. The application employs the Bloc pattern for state management, ensuring a predictable and maintainable UI. [S18]

## 2. Architecture Patterns Used

The CryptoWave application adheres to a **Component-Based Architecture**. This pattern is evident in the modular structure of the UI, where distinct features and functionalities are encapsulated within reusable components. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability. [S18]

## 3. Component Breakdown

The project is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

## 4. Data Flow and Dependencies

The application interacts with the CoinGecko API for real-time cryptocurrency market data. [S1, S7, S18, S19] The `lib/repositories/coin_repository.dart` file is central to fetching this data, abstracting direct API calls. [S1, S2, S4, S5, S10, S12, S13, S14] The `lib/network/exception_handler.dart` class is responsible for processing and standardizing API-related exceptions. [S6, S11, S15]

Key relationships observed in the codebase include:

*   `lib/main.dart` extends `StatelessWidget.dart`.
*   `lib/models/coin/coin_model.freezed.dart` extends `CoinModel.dart` and implements `RoiModel.dart`.
*   `lib/models/coin_details/crypto_chart_data_model/crypto_chart_data_model.freezed.dart` implements `CryptoChartDataModel.dart` and `DataPointModel.dart`.
*   `lib/network/exception_handler.dart` implements `Exception.dart` and extends `ApiException.dart`.
*   `lib/network/http_client.dart` imports `dart:async` and `dart:convert`. [S16]

## 5. Design Decisions and Rationale

The application utilizes a **Component-Based Architecture** to promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability. [S18] The Bloc pattern is employed for state management, ensuring a predictable and maintainable UI. [S18] The repository pattern is used to abstract direct API interactions, providing a clean separation of concerns for data fetching. [S1, S2, S4, S5, S10, S12, S13, S14]

## 6. Scalability Considerations

Scalability considerations are mentioned in the context of system requirements, suggesting that the application's design should accommodate growth. [S16]

## 7. Security Architecture

Authentication is not explicitly handled or documented within the provided code snippets. The application interacts directly with the CoinGecko API, which may have its own authentication requirements not detailed here. [S2, S3, S4, S8, S11, S14, S15] The API does not require authentication, and all data is publicly accessible through the CoinGecko API. [S1, S5, S6, S7, S10, S12, S13]

## 8. Performance Considerations

Performance considerations are not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

Deployment architecture details are not provided in the context.

## 10. Future Architecture Improvements

Future architecture improvements are not detailed in the provided context.

## 11. Technology Stack Rationale

The rationale for choosing specific technologies is not detailed in the provided context.

## 12. Integration Points

The primary integration point is the **CoinGecko API**, which CryptoWave leverages to fetch real-time cryptocurrency market data, prices, trends, and detailed coin information. [S1, S7, S18, S19]
