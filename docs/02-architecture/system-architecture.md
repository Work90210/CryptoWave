# CryptoWave Architecture Documentation

## 1. System Overview

CryptoWave is a Flutter application designed for tracking cryptocurrency prices, trends, and market data. It utilizes the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time information, providing users with detailed coin data and interactive price charts. The application is built with a focus on a clean UI and efficient state management.

## 2. Architecture Patterns Used

The CryptoWave application employs the following architectural patterns:

*   **Bloc Pattern:** State management is handled using the `flutter_bloc` package, facilitating a predictable state management approach.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is structured into reusable components, promoting modularity and maintainability.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The codebase exhibits a feature-based modular organization, with components categorized into `04-apis`, `rest-api`, and `common`.

*   **`lib/`**: Contains the core application logic and UI code.
    *   `lib/main.dart`: The application's entry point, likely extending `StatelessWidget`.
    *   `lib/models/coin/coin_model.freezed.dart`: Generated code for `CoinModel`, likely using `freezed`.
    *   `lib/models/coin/coin_model.freezed.dart` also shows relationships with `CoinModel.dart` (extends) and `RoiModel.dart` (implements).
    *   `lib/models/coin_details/crypto_chart_data_model/crypto_chart_data_model.freezed.dart`: Generated code for `CryptoChartDataModel`, with relationships to `CryptoChartDataModel.dart` (implements) and `DataPointModel.dart` (implements).

*   **`pubspec.yaml`**: Defines project dependencies and metadata.
*   **`test/`**: Contains unit and integration tests.

## 4. Data Flow and Dependencies

The application relies on the CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency data. The `lib/network/http_client.dart` file is responsible for making these API requests, likely handling asynchronous operations and data serialization/deserialization. The `lib/network/exception_handler.dart` is used to manage and process network-related errors.

Key relationships observed in the code include:

*   **Inheritance:** `StatelessWidget.dart` is extended by `lib/main.dart`. `CoinModel.dart` is extended by `lib/models/coin/coin_model.freezed.dart`. `CryptoChartDataModel.dart` and `DataPointModel.dart` are implemented by `lib/models/coin_details/crypto_chart_data_model/crypto_chart_data_model.freezed.dart`. `ApiException.dart` is extended by `lib/network/exception_handler.dart`.
*   **Implementation:** `RoiModel.dart` is implemented by `lib/models/coin/coin_model.freezed.dart`. `Exception.dart` is implemented by `lib/network/exception_handler.dart`.
*   **Imports:** `lib/network/http_client.dart` imports `dart:async` and `dart:convert`.

## 5. Design Decisions and Rationale

*   **Flutter:** Chosen for cross-platform development, enabling a single codebase for both iOS and Android.
*   **Bloc Pattern:** Selected for robust state management, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and predictable state transitions.
*   **Freezed:** Used for code generation of immutable models, improving code safety and reducing boilerplate.
*   **CoinGecko API:** The primary data source, providing comprehensive and up-to-date cryptocurrency market data.
*   **Markdown for Documentation:** Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and widespread support in development workflows.

## 6. Scalability Considerations

The modular architecture and the use of the Bloc pattern contribute to the application's scalability. Separating concerns into distinct components and managing state effectively allows for easier addition of new features and modifications without impacting other parts of the application.

## 7. Security Architecture

*   **Internet Permission:** The `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml` and `android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml` files declare the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission, which is necessary for network communication.
*   **Data Protection:** TODO: Specific data protection measures are not detailed in the provided context.
*   **Authentication:** TODO: No explicit authentication system is described in the provided context.

## 8. Performance Considerations

*   **Interactive Charts:** The use of FL Chart for interactive price charts suggests a focus on providing a responsive and engaging user experience for data visualization.
*   **State Management:** The Bloc pattern aids in managing application state efficiently, which can contribute to better performance by preventing unnecessary rebuilds.
*   **Monitoring:** TODO: Specific performance monitoring tools or strategies are not detailed in the provided context.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

The application is built for Android and iOS using Flutter. The `android/` directory contains configurations for Android deployment, including Gradle settings and manifest files.

## 10. Future Architecture Improvements

TODO: Future architecture improvements are not detailed in the provided context.

## 11. Technology Stack Rationale

*   **Flutter:** Chosen for its ability to deliver high-performance, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
*   **Bloc Pattern (`flutter_bloc`):** Provides a structured way to manage state, making the application more predictable and maintainable, especially as complexity grows.
*   **Freezed:** Simplifies the creation of immutable data models, reducing the likelihood of bugs related to mutable state and improving code clarity.
*   **CoinGecko API:** A widely recognized and comprehensive API for cryptocurrency market data, offering a rich dataset for the application's features.
*   **FL Chart:** A powerful charting library for Flutter, enabling the creation of interactive and visually appealing price charts.

## 12. Integration Points

*   **CoinGecko API:** The primary external integration point for fetching cryptocurrency market data.
*   **Flutter Tooling:** Integrates with Flutter's development tools for hot reload, debugging, and building.
