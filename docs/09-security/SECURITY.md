# CryptoWave Security Documentation

This document outlines the security architecture, practices, and considerations for the CryptoWave project.

## 1. Security Architecture Overview

CryptoWave is designed with security as a foundational principle. The architecture aims to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of financial transactions. Key security considerations are integrated at various layers, from client-side interactions to data storage and backend processing.

The project utilizes a mobile-first approach, with an Android application developed using Kotlin and potentially an iOS counterpart using Swift. The backend services, while not explicitly detailed in the provided file list, are assumed to handle core business logic and data persistence.

**Key Security Principles:**

*   **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect against various threats.
*   **Least Privilege:** Users and system components are granted only the necessary permissions to perform their functions.
*   **Secure by Design:** Security is considered from the initial design phases of features and components.

## 2. Authentication Mechanisms

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system.

*   **Current Implementation:** The provided file list does not contain explicit code for authentication mechanisms (e.g., login forms, token generation, OAuth).
*   **TODO:** Detailed documentation on the specific authentication methods employed (e.g., username/password, biometrics, social login, multi-factor authentication) is required. This should include information on how user credentials are handled and verified.

## 3. Authorization and Access Control

Authorization determines what authenticated users are allowed to do.

*   **Current Implementation:** No specific authorization logic is evident in the provided files.
*   **TODO:** Documentation on how access to different features and data is controlled based on user roles or permissions is needed. This includes defining roles, permissions, and the enforcement mechanisms.

## 4. Data Protection and Encryption

Protecting sensitive data both in transit and at rest is crucial.

*   **In Transit:**
    *   **Current Implementation:** The use of HTTPS/TLS for secure communication is assumed for all network requests. The `AndroidManifest.xml` files may contain network security configurations.
    *   **TODO:** Specific details on TLS version requirements and cipher suites used should be documented.
*   **At Rest:**
    *   **Current Implementation:** The file list does not reveal specific data storage mechanisms or encryption implementations for data stored locally on the device or on backend servers.
    *   **TODO:** Documentation on how sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, financial information) is encrypted at rest, including the algorithms and key management strategies, is required.

## 5. Input Validation and Sanitization

Preventing malicious input from compromising the application is a core security practice.

*   **Current Implementation:** Input validation and sanitization logic is typically implemented within the application's code, particularly in Kotlin and Swift files. The provided file list does not contain specific examples of these implementations.
*   **TODO:** Document the strategies used for validating and sanitizing all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## 6. SQL Injection Prevention

Protecting against SQL injection attacks is vital for applications interacting with databases.

*   **Current Implementation:** The provided file list does not contain direct evidence of database interaction code or specific SQL injection prevention measures.
*   **TODO:** If a relational database is used, document the methods employed to prevent SQL injection, such as parameterized queries or stored procedures.

## 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

*   **Current Implementation:** As a mobile application, the direct risk of traditional web-based XSS is mitigated. However, if web views are used within the mobile app, or if there's a web component, XSS prevention is still relevant. The provided files do not indicate the use of web views or web components.
*   **TODO:** If web views are utilized, document the sanitization of HTML content displayed within them and any other measures to prevent script execution from untrusted sources.

## 8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

CSRF attacks trick users into performing unwanted actions on a web application.

*   **Current Implementation:** CSRF is primarily a concern for web applications. For mobile applications, similar principles apply to preventing unauthorized actions initiated by malicious third parties. The provided files do not offer specific CSRF protection mechanisms.
*   **TODO:** Document any measures taken to prevent unauthorized actions, such as token-based verification for sensitive operations, especially if the application interacts with web APIs.

## 9. Security Headers and CSP

Security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) are web-specific security mechanisms.

*   **Current Implementation:** These are not directly applicable to native mobile applications unless web views are used. The `AndroidManifest.xml` files might contain network security configurations that serve a similar purpose for network requests.
*   **TODO:** If web views are used, document the implementation of security headers and CSP to restrict resource loading and script execution.

## 10. API Security (Rate Limiting, API Keys)

Securing backend APIs is critical for application integrity.

*   **Current Implementation:** The provided file list does not contain backend API code.
*   **TODO:** Document the API security measures, including:
    *   **API Keys:** How API keys are generated, managed, and used for authentication and authorization.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** The implementation of rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Authentication:** The authentication methods used for API requests (e.g., JWT, OAuth tokens).

## 11. Session Management

Securely managing user sessions is vital for maintaining authenticated states.

*   **Current Implementation:** No explicit session management code is visible in the provided files.
*   **TODO:** Document the session management strategy, including:
    *   How session tokens are generated, stored, and invalidated.
    *   Session timeout policies.
    *   Measures to prevent session hijacking.

## 12. Password Security and Hashing

Protecting user passwords requires robust hashing and salting.

*   **Current Implementation:** No password hashing implementations are visible in the provided files.
*   **TODO:** Document the password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2) and salting strategy used. Specify if passwords are ever stored in plain text (which should be avoided).

## 13. Secure Communication (HTTPS/TLS)

Ensuring data is encrypted during transmission.

*   **Current Implementation:** The `AndroidManifest.xml` files are the primary location for network security configurations in Android.
    *   `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`
    *   `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
    *   `android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml`
    These files may define network security configurations, including trust anchors and cleartext traffic policies.
*   **TODO:** Review the `AndroidManifest.xml` files for specific configurations related to HTTPS enforcement, certificate pinning, and allowed cleartext traffic.

## 14. Environment Variables and Secrets Management

Securely handling sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.

*   **Current Implementation:**
    *   `android/gradle.properties`
    *   `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
    These files might contain build-time configurations. Secrets should ideally not be hardcoded here.
*   **TODO:** Document the strategy for managing environment variables and secrets. This includes:
    *   How sensitive information is accessed during development and deployment.
    *   Tools or services used for secrets management (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secrets managers).
    *   Procedures to prevent secrets from being committed to version control.

## 15. Dependency Security (Vulnerability Scanning)

Ensuring that third-party libraries do not introduce security vulnerabilities.

*   **Current Implementation:**
    *   `analysis_options.yaml`
    *   `devtools_options.yaml`
    These files can be used to configure static analysis tools, which may include security checks.
*   **TODO:** Document the process for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in project dependencies. This includes:
    *   Tools used for dependency scanning (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk).
    *   The frequency of scans.
    *   The process for updating vulnerable dependencies.

## 16. Security Testing Strategy

A comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing security flaws.

*   **Current Implementation:** The `docs/` directory contains meta-documentation related to testing (`doc-metrics.md`, `doc-tools.md`), but no specific security testing strategy is detailed.
*   **TODO:** Outline the security testing strategy, including:
