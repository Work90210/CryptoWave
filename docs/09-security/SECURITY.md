# CryptoWave Security Documentation

This document outlines the security architecture, practices, and considerations for the CryptoWave project.

## 1. Security Architecture Overview

CryptoWave is designed with security as a foundational principle. The architecture aims to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity of the application. Key security considerations are integrated at various levels, from data storage to network communication.

The project utilizes a mobile-first approach, with the primary client application developed in Dart (Flutter) and native Android components in Kotlin. Backend services, if any, are not detailed in the provided file structure. Security measures are therefore focused on the client-side and data handling within the mobile application.

## 2. Authentication Mechanisms

The provided codebase does not contain explicit authentication mechanism implementations. The `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` files define application permissions and components but do not specify authentication flows.

**TODO:** Document the authentication mechanisms used by CryptoWave, including user registration, login, and any multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations.

## 3. Authorization and Access Control

Similar to authentication, the provided files do not reveal specific authorization or access control logic. Access to features and data is assumed to be managed by the application's business logic, which is not detailed here.

**TODO:** Detail how authorization is handled within CryptoWave. This includes role-based access control (RBAC), permission checks, and how access to sensitive features or data is restricted.

## 4. Data Protection and Encryption

The codebase does not explicitly show client-side encryption implementations for data at rest or in transit. The `assets/lottie/error.json` file is a Lottie animation and does not contain sensitive data.

**TODO:** Describe the methods used for protecting sensitive user data. This includes:
*   **Data at Rest:** Any encryption or obfuscation techniques applied to data stored locally on the device.
*   **Data in Transit:** The protocols and methods used to secure data exchanged between the client and any backend services.

## 5. Input Validation and Sanitization

Input validation and sanitization are critical for preventing various injection attacks. The provided files do not contain specific code for input validation.

**TODO:** Document the strategies and implementations for validating and sanitizing all user inputs to prevent malicious data from being processed. This includes validation on both the client-side and any server-side validation if applicable.

## 6. SQL Injection Prevention

As no database interactions or SQL queries are visible in the provided files, specific SQL injection prevention measures cannot be identified.

**TODO:** If CryptoWave interacts with a database, detail the measures taken to prevent SQL injection. This typically involves using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

## 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

XSS prevention is primarily a concern for web applications. For mobile applications, similar vulnerabilities can arise from handling untrusted data displayed within UI components. The provided files do not show specific XSS prevention techniques.

**TODO:** Describe how CryptoWave prevents XSS-like vulnerabilities, particularly when displaying data from external sources or user-generated content within the mobile UI.

## 8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

CSRF protection is typically implemented in web applications to prevent unauthorized actions. For mobile applications, the concept is less direct but can involve ensuring that requests are authenticated and authorized appropriately. No specific CSRF protection mechanisms are evident.

**TODO:** Explain any measures taken to prevent unauthorized actions initiated by malicious third parties, especially if CryptoWave interacts with web-based APIs.

## 9. Security Headers and CSP

Security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) are web-specific security mechanisms. These are not directly applicable to native mobile applications in the same way.

**TODO:** If CryptoWave utilizes WebViews or interacts with web content, document any security headers or CSP configurations applied to those web contexts.

## 10. API Security (Rate Limiting, API Keys)

The provided files do not contain backend API definitions or client-side API interaction code.

**TODO:** Detail the security measures for any APIs used by CryptoWave:
*   **API Keys:** How API keys are managed, stored, and used for authentication/authorization.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Mechanisms in place to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks through API rate limiting.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** How API endpoints are secured.

## 11. Session Management

The provided files do not contain explicit session management implementations.

**TODO:** Describe how user sessions are managed within CryptoWave. This includes session token generation, storage, expiration, and invalidation.

## 12. Password Security and Hashing

No password handling logic is visible in the provided files.

**TODO:** Document the password security practices:
*   **Storage:** How user passwords are stored (e.g., salted and hashed).
*   **Hashing Algorithms:** The specific hashing algorithms used (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2).
*   **Password Policies:** Any enforced password complexity requirements.

## 13. Secure Communication (HTTPS/TLS)

The provided files do not explicitly configure network communication protocols.

**TODO:** Confirm that all network communication between the CryptoWave client and any backend services uses HTTPS with TLS encryption. Detail any certificate pinning or other TLS hardening measures.

## 14. Environment Variables and Secrets Management

The `android/gradle.properties` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` files are present, which are common locations for build-time configurations. However, they do not appear to contain sensitive secrets in the provided context.

**TODO:** Document how sensitive information (API keys, credentials, etc.) is managed. This includes:
*   **Storage:** Where secrets are stored (e.g., environment variables, secure configuration files, secrets management services).
*   **Access:** How these secrets are accessed during development and deployment.
*   **Exclusion from Version Control:** Ensuring secrets are not committed to the repository.

## 15. Dependency Security (Vulnerability Scanning)

The `analysis_options.yaml` and `devtools_options.yaml` files are present, which are used for code analysis and linting.

**TODO:** Describe the process for managing and securing project dependencies:
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Tools and processes used to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`, `gradle dependencyCheck`, OWASP Dependency-Check).
*   **Update Strategy:** How and when dependencies are updated to incorporate security patches.

## 16. Security Testing Strategy

The `docs/00-meta` directory contains documentation related to development processes, but no specific security testing strategy is detailed.

**TODO:** Outline the security testing strategy for CryptoWave:
*   **Types of Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, penetration testing, vulnerability assessments.
*   **Tools and Frameworks:** Any specific tools used for security testing.
*   **Frequency:** How often security testing is performed.

## 17. Incident Response Plan

No incident response plan is evident in the provided files.

**TODO:** Detail the incident response plan for security breaches or vulnerabilities:
*   **Detection:** How security incidents are identified.
*   **Containment:** Steps to limit the impact of an incident.
*   **Eradication:** How the root cause of an incident is removed.
*   **Recovery:** Procedures for restoring affected systems and data.
*   **Post-Incident Analysis:** Lessons learned and improvements to prevent recurrence.
*   **Communication:** Protocols for notifying stakeholders and users.

## 18. Security Monitoring and Logging

The provided files do not contain explicit configurations for security monitoring or logging.

**TODO:** Describe the security monitoring and logging practices:
*   **Logging:** What security-relevant events are logged (e.g., failed login attempts, access to sensitive data, configuration changes).
*   **Monitoring:** How logs are monitored for suspicious activity.
*   **Alerting:** Mechanisms for alerting security personnel to potential threats.

## 19. Compliance Requirements

No compliance-related documentation is present.

**TODO:** List any relevant compliance standards or regulations that CryptoWave must adhere to (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS) and how the project ensures compliance.

## 20. Security Best Practices and Guidelines

The `docs/00-meta` directory contains general documentation standards and processes.

**TODO:** Enumerate the security best practices and guidelines followed by the CryptoWave development team. This should include:
*   Secure coding principles.
*   Handling of sensitive data.
*   Code review processes for security.
*   Developer training on security awareness.
*   Principles of least privilege.
