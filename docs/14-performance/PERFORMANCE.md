# CryptoWave Performance Documentation

This document outlines the performance architecture, optimization strategies, monitoring, and testing approaches for the CryptoWave application.

## 1. Performance Architecture Overview

The CryptoWave application is a cross-platform mobile application built using Dart and Flutter, targeting both Android and iOS. Its architecture is designed to deliver a responsive user experience while efficiently managing resources.

The core components include:
*   **Frontend (Flutter):** Handles UI rendering, user interactions, and local state management.
*   **Backend APIs:** Provide data, business logic, and authentication services.
*   **Database:** Stores persistent application data.

Performance considerations are integrated at each layer, from efficient UI rendering in Flutter to optimized API responses and database interactions.

## 2. Frontend Performance Optimization

The frontend performance is critical for user experience. Optimizations focus on reducing rendering times, minimizing memory usage, and ensuring smooth animations.

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

*   **Strategy:** While Flutter's build process typically bundles the entire application, dynamic imports can be used for features that are not immediately required. This is particularly relevant for large feature sets or modules that are accessed infrequently.
*   **Implementation:** TODO: Document specific implementation details for dynamic imports if used.

### Bundle Size Optimization
