# CryptoWave Performance Documentation

This document outlines the performance architecture, optimization strategies, monitoring, and testing approaches for the CryptoWave application.

## 1. Performance Architecture Overview

The CryptoWave application is a cross-platform mobile application built using Dart and Flutter, targeting both Android and iOS. Its architecture is designed to balance responsiveness, resource utilization, and scalability.

The core components include:
*   **Frontend (Flutter):** Handles UI rendering, user interactions, and local state management.
*   **Backend APIs:** Provide data, business logic, and authentication services.
*   **Database:** Stores persistent application data.

Performance considerations are integrated at each layer, from efficient UI rendering and network communication to optimized data storage and retrieval.

## 2. Frontend Performance Optimization

The frontend performance is critical for user experience. Optimizations focus on reducing rendering times, minimizing memory usage, and ensuring smooth interactions.

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

*   **Strategy:** Flutter's build system inherently supports code splitting. Features and their associated code can be organized into separate libraries or modules that are loaded on demand.
*   **Implementation:** While specific code splitting implementations are not detailed in the provided file list, this is a standard Flutter optimization technique. Developers should organize features into distinct packages or use dynamic imports where appropriate.

### Bundle Size Optimization

*   **Strategy:** Minimizing the size of the application bundle reduces download times and initial load times.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Carefully select and manage dependencies. Remove unused libraries.
    *   **Asset Optimization:** Compress and optimize images and other assets. The `assets/lottie/error.json` file suggests the use of Lottie animations, which are generally efficient.
    *   **Code Minification:** Flutter's release builds automatically minify Dart code.

### Image Optimization

*   **Strategy:** Efficiently load and display images to prevent UI jank and reduce memory consumption.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Format Selection:** Use appropriate image formats (e.g., WebP for Android, HEIC for iOS where supported).
    *   **Resizing:** Serve images at the appropriate resolution for the display.
