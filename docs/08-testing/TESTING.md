# Testing Documentation

This document outlines the testing strategy, frameworks, and guidelines for the CryptoWave project. It covers various testing levels, from unit tests to end-to-end scenarios, ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of the application.

## 1. Testing Strategy Overview

The CryptoWave project employs a comprehensive testing strategy designed to ensure high-quality software delivery. This strategy is built upon the principles of the testing pyramid, emphasizing a strong foundation of unit tests, supported by integration tests, and complemented by end-to-end (E2E) tests. The goal is to identify and resolve defects early in the development lifecycle, reduce regression risks, and deliver a stable and performant application across all supported platforms.

## 2. Testing Pyramid

The testing strategy adheres to the testing pyramid model:

*   **Unit Tests:** The base of the pyramid, focusing on testing individual units of code (functions, methods, classes) in isolation. These tests are fast, numerous, and provide granular feedback.
*   **Integration Tests:** Situated above unit tests, these tests verify the interaction between different components or modules. They ensure that integrated parts function correctly together.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** The apex of the pyramid, these tests simulate real user scenarios from start to finish, covering the entire application flow. They are fewer in number, slower, and more brittle but provide the highest confidence in overall application functionality.

## 3. Testing Framework Setup

The project utilizes different testing frameworks based on the platform and language:

*   **iOS (Swift):**
    *   **Unit Testing:** XCTest framework is used for unit testing Swift code.
    *   **Integration/E2E Testing:** XCUITest framework is used for UI testing and integration testing of the iOS application.
*   **Flutter (Dart):**
    *   **Unit Testing:** The `test` package (built into Flutter) is used for unit testing Dart code.
    *   **Widget Testing:** The `flutter_test` package is used for testing individual Flutter widgets.
    *   **Integration/E2E Testing:** Flutter's integration testing capabilities, often leveraging packages like `integration_test`, are used for testing across devices and emulators.

The `pubspec.yaml` file lists the testing dependencies for the Flutter project.

## 4. Unit Testing Guidelines

*   **Scope:** Unit tests should focus on testing the smallest testable parts of the application, such as individual functions, methods, or classes.
*   **Isolation:** Each unit test should be independent and not rely on external dependencies or other tests. Mocks and stubs should be used to isolate the unit under test.
*   **Assertions:** Use clear and specific assertions to verify expected outcomes.
*   **Naming:** Test function names should be descriptive, indicating what is being tested and the expected outcome (e.g., `test_calculateTotal_withValidInput_returnsCorrectSum`).
*   **Readability:** Unit tests should be easy to read and understand.
*   **Coverage:** Aim for high unit test coverage for business logic and critical functions.

## 5. Integration Testing Approach

*   **Purpose:** Integration tests validate the interactions between different modules or services. This includes testing API calls, database interactions, and inter-component communication.
*   **Scope:** Focus on testing the integration points between components that have already been unit tested.
*   **Dependencies:** Integration tests may require setting up specific environments or data.
*   **Frameworks:**
    *   **iOS:** XCUITest can be used for integration testing of UI components and their interactions.
    *   **Flutter:** The `integration_test` package can be used to test the interaction of multiple widgets or services.

## 6. End-to-End Testing Strategy

*   **Purpose:** E2E tests simulate real user scenarios to validate the complete application flow from the user interface to the backend services.
*   **Scope:** Cover critical user journeys, such as user registration, login, performing core actions within the app, and logging out.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **iOS:** XCUITest is the primary tool for E2E testing on iOS.
    *   **Flutter:** The `integration_test` package is used for E2E testing on Flutter, allowing tests to run on actual devices or simulators.
*   **Maintainability:** E2E tests should be robust and maintainable, with clear selectors and minimal reliance on timing.

## 7. Test Data Management

*   **Strategy:** Test data should be managed to ensure test reliability and reproducibility.
*   **Unit Tests:** Test data for unit tests should be generated within the test itself or loaded from simple, self-contained data structures.
*   **Integration/E2E Tests:**
    *   **Seeding:** Test environments should be seeded with consistent test data before test execution.
    *   **Cleanup:** Mechanisms should be in place to clean up test data after execution to prevent interference between test runs.
    *   **Fixtures:** Consider using test fixtures or data factories for generating complex test data.

## 8. Mocking and Stubbing Strategies

*   **Purpose:** Mocking and stubbing are essential for isolating units of code and simulating dependencies during testing.
*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   **iOS:** Use mocking frameworks like `OHHTTPStubs` for network requests or create mock objects manually.
    *   **Flutter:** Use packages like `mockito` for creating mock objects for Dart classes and services.
*   **Integration Tests:** Mocking may be used selectively to isolate specific integration points.
*   **E2E Tests:** Generally, E2E tests aim to test with real dependencies, but mocking can be used for specific scenarios, such as simulating network errors.

## 9. Test Coverage Requirements

*   **Unit Tests:** Aim for a high unit test coverage percentage (e.g., 80%+) for critical business logic and utility functions. Coverage reports should be generated and reviewed.
*   **Integration Tests:** While formal coverage metrics are less common for integration tests, ensure that all key integration points are covered by at least one test.
*   **E2E Tests:** Focus on covering the most critical user flows and functionalities. The number of E2E tests should be sufficient to provide confidence in the overall application.

## 10. Performance Testing

*   **Purpose:** Performance testing aims to evaluate the responsiveness, stability, and resource usage of the application under various loads.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Load Testing:** Assess application performance under expected load.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Determine the application's breaking point by increasing the load beyond normal operational capacity.
    *   **Soak Testing:** Evaluate performance over an extended period to detect memory leaks or performance degradation.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **iOS:** Instruments (part of Xcode) can be used for performance profiling.
    *   **Flutter:** Flutter DevTools provides performance profiling capabilities.

## 11. Security Testing

*   **Purpose:** Security testing identifies vulnerabilities and ensures the application is protected against common threats.
*   **Areas to Cover:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Verify that access controls are correctly implemented.
    *   **Data Protection:** Ensure sensitive data is stored and transmitted securely (e.g., encryption).
    *   **Input Validation:** Test for vulnerabilities related to improper input handling (e.g., injection attacks).
    *   **Secure API Interactions:** Verify the security of communication with backend services.
*   **Tools:** Static analysis tools, dynamic analysis tools, and manual penetration testing can be employed.

## 12. Accessibility Testing

*   **Purpose:** Accessibility testing ensures that the application is usable by people with disabilities.
*   **Guidelines:** Adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **iOS:** Utilize VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and other accessibility features in Xcode.
    *   **Flutter:** Test with screen readers and ensure proper semantic information is provided for widgets.
