# Testing Documentation

This document outlines the testing strategy, frameworks, and guidelines for the CryptoWave project.

## 1. Testing Strategy Overview

The CryptoWave project employs a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the application across different platforms. The strategy is built upon the principles of the testing pyramid, emphasizing a strong foundation of unit tests, supported by integration tests, and complemented by end-to-end (E2E) tests. This layered approach aims to catch defects early in the development cycle, reduce the cost of fixing bugs, and provide confidence in the application's behavior.

## 2. Testing Pyramid

The testing strategy adheres to the testing pyramid model:

*   **Unit Tests:** The base of the pyramid, focusing on testing individual units of code (functions, methods, classes) in isolation. These tests are fast, numerous, and provide granular feedback.
*   **Integration Tests:** The middle layer, verifying the interaction between different components or modules of the application. These tests ensure that integrated parts work together as expected.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** The top of the pyramid, simulating real user scenarios from start to finish. These tests validate the complete application flow and user experience.

## 3. Testing Framework Setup

The project utilizes different testing frameworks based on the platform and language:

*   **iOS (Swift):** XCTest is the primary framework for unit and integration testing of iOS components.
*   **Flutter (Dart):**
    *   `test` package: Used for unit and widget testing of Dart code.
    *   `flutter_test` package: Provides utilities for widget testing, allowing for the rendering and interaction with UI components.
*   **Android (Kotlin):** JUnit and Espresso are used for unit and integration testing of Android components.

The `pubspec.yaml` file lists the testing dependencies for the Flutter project.

## 4. Unit Testing Guidelines

*   **Scope:** Unit tests should focus on testing the smallest testable parts of the application, such as individual functions, methods, or classes.
*   **Isolation:** Each unit test should be independent and not rely on external dependencies or the state of other tests. Mocking and stubbing are crucial for achieving isolation.
*   **Assertions:** Use clear and specific assertions to verify the expected outcomes of the code under test.
*   **Readability:** Write unit tests that are easy to read and understand, with descriptive test names.
*   **Coverage:** Aim for high unit test coverage for business logic and critical functions.

## 5. Integration Testing Approach

*   **Purpose:** Integration tests verify the interactions between different modules or services within the application. This includes testing API calls, database interactions, and inter-component communication.
*   **Scope:** Integration tests should cover scenarios where multiple units collaborate to achieve a specific functionality.
*   **Dependencies:** Where possible, external dependencies (e.g., actual network requests, databases) should be mocked or stubbed to ensure test stability and speed. However, some integration tests may require a controlled environment with actual dependencies.

## 6. End-to-End Testing Strategy

*   **Purpose:** E2E tests validate the complete application flow from the user's perspective, covering critical user journeys and scenarios.
*   **Tools:** For Flutter applications, E2E tests are typically written using the `flutter_driver` package or similar tools that interact with the running application.
*   **Scenarios:** Focus on testing key user flows such as user registration, login, data submission, and navigation between screens.
*   **Environment:** E2E tests are usually executed on emulators or real devices to simulate the production environment.

## 7. Test Data Management

*   **Generation:** Test data should be generated programmatically or sourced from controlled fixtures. Avoid hardcoding sensitive or large amounts of data directly within test files.
*   **Isolation:** Each test should ideally start with a clean slate of test data to ensure independence.
*   **Fixtures:** Utilize fixture files (e.g., JSON files) to store reusable test data.

## 8. Mocking and Stubbing Strategies

*   **Purpose:** Mocking and stubbing are essential for isolating the code under test and controlling external dependencies.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   **Swift:** Mocking frameworks like `OHHTTPStubs` or manual mocking techniques can be employed.
    *   **Dart:** The `mockito` package is commonly used for mocking in Dart.
*   **Usage:** Mock dependencies like network clients, databases, or services to return predefined responses or simulate specific behaviors (e.g., errors).

## 9. Test Coverage Requirements

*   **Unit Tests:** A high level of unit test coverage is expected for critical business logic and utility functions. The `coverage` tool can be used to measure and report test coverage.
*   **Integration Tests:** Coverage for integration tests should focus on the interaction points between components.
*   **E2E Tests:** While not measured by line coverage, E2E tests should cover all critical user flows and scenarios.

## 10. Performance Testing

*   **Purpose:** Performance testing aims to evaluate the application's responsiveness, stability, and resource usage under various loads.
*   **Metrics:** Key metrics include startup time, screen transition speed, memory usage, and CPU utilization.
*   **Tools:** Platform-specific profiling tools (e.g., Xcode Instruments for iOS, Android Studio Profiler for Android) and Flutter's performance profiling tools can be used.

## 11. Security Testing

*   **Purpose:** Security testing focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the application is protected against common threats.
*   **Areas:** This includes testing authentication, authorization, data encryption, input validation, and secure handling of sensitive information.
*   **Tools:** Static analysis security testing (SAST) and dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) tools can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 12. Accessibility Testing

*   **Purpose:** Accessibility testing ensures that the application is usable by people with disabilities.
*   **Guidelines:** Adherence to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is recommended.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **iOS:** Accessibility Inspector in Xcode.
    *   **Flutter:** `flutter_test` provides utilities for accessibility checks, and platform-specific accessibility features can be tested on devices.
*   **Considerations:** Focus on screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and resizable text.

## 13. Cross-Browser Testing

*   **Applicability:** This section is primarily relevant for web applications. For mobile applications like CryptoWave, cross-device and cross-OS version testing is more pertinent.

## 14. Mobile Testing

*   **Platforms:** The application is developed for both iOS and Android.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **iOS:** Tests are written in Swift using XCTest and executed on simulators or physical iOS devices.
    *   **Android:** Tests are written in Kotlin using JUnit and Espresso, executed on emulators or physical Android devices.
    *   **Flutter:** Widget tests and E2E tests are written in Dart and executed on both iOS and Android platforms.
*   **Device Coverage:** A representative range of devices and OS versions should be targeted for testing.

## 15. Test Environment Setup

*   **Development:** Developers set up their local development environments with necessary SDKs, IDEs, and testing tools.
*   **CI/CD:** A dedicated CI/CD environment is used for automated testing, ensuring consistent test execution. This environment should mirror the production environment as closely as possible.

## 16. Running Tests Locally

*   **iOS (Swift):**
    *   Navigate to the `ios` directory.
    *   Run `xcodebuild test -project Runner.xcodeproj -scheme Runner -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'`.
*   **Flutter (Dart):**
    *   From the root of the project:
        *   For unit tests: `flutter test`
        *   For widget tests: `flutter test test/widget_test.dart` (or specific widget test files)
        *   For E2E tests: `flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart` (assuming integration tests are set up this way).
*   **Android (Kotlin):**
    *   Navigate to the `android` directory.
    *   Run `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` for unit tests.
    *   Run `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` for instrumented (integration) tests.

## 17. CI/CD Integration for Testing

*   **Purpose:** To automate the testing process upon code commits or pull requests.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Code is pushed to the repository.
    2.  CI/CD pipeline is triggered.
    3.  Dependencies are fetched.
    4.  Code is built.
    5.  Unit tests are executed.
    6.  Integration tests are executed.
    7.  E2E tests are executed (on emulators/devices).
    8.  Test reports are generated and stored.
    9.  Build status is reported back to the repository.
*   **Tools:** CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins can be integrated.

## 18. Test Reporting and Metrics

*   **Format:** Test results should be generated in standard formats like JUnit XML for easy integration with CI/CD tools.
