# `main` Component

The `main` component is the entry point of the CryptoWave Flutter application. It initializes the application and sets up the root widget.

## Purpose

The `main` component is responsible for launching the CryptoWave application. It serves as the primary starting point for the Flutter framework to render the application's UI.

## Usage

The `main` function is automatically called when the application starts. It calls the `runApp` function, passing an instance of the `CryptoWave` widget.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(const CryptoWave());
}
```
