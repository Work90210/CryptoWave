## MainActivity

The `MainActivity` is the primary entry point for the CryptoWave Android application. It serves as the host for the Flutter engine and manages the lifecycle of the Flutter application within the Android environment.

### Purpose and Usage

`MainActivity` is responsible for initializing and running the Flutter UI. It is used when the application is launched on an Android device.

### Props/Parameters

The `MainActivity` class does not expose any configurable props or parameters directly.

### Usage Examples

```kotlin
package com.example.cryptowave

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterActivity() {
}
```

### Accessibility Notes

Accessibility for the Flutter UI is managed within the Flutter framework itself. Ensure that Flutter widgets used within the application adhere to accessibility best practices as outlined by Flutter's accessibility documentation.

### Styling and Theming

Styling and theming of the application are handled within the Flutter UI code, not directly within `MainActivity`.

### Performance Considerations

Performance is primarily influenced by the efficiency of the Flutter UI and the underlying Dart code. Ensure that the Flutter engine is initialized efficiently and that the Flutter application itself is optimized for performance.

### Related Components and Files

*   **Flutter Engine:** Managed internally by `MainActivity`.
*   **Flutter UI Code:** Located within the `lib` directory of the project.
