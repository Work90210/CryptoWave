## AppBar

The `AppBar` component is a UI element used for displaying titles and navigation actions at the top of the screen.

### Purpose and Usage

The `AppBar` is used to provide a consistent header across different screens of the CryptoWave application. It typically displays the current screen's title and may include action buttons for navigation or specific screen functionalities.

### Props

The `AppBar` component accepts the following properties:

*   `title`: A `String` representing the title to be displayed in the app bar.
*   `actions`: A `List<Widget>` of widgets to display as actions in the app bar.
*   `leading`: A `Widget` to display before the title.

### Usage Example

```dart
AppBar(
  title: Text('CryptoWave'),
  actions: <Widget>[
    IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle settings action
      },
    ),
  ],
)
