# Service Locator

The `ServiceLocator` is a utility class used for dependency injection within the CryptoWave application. It facilitates the retrieval of registered services.

## Purpose

The `ServiceLocator` is used to access instances of services that have been registered with the locator. This promotes a decoupled architecture by allowing components to obtain dependencies without direct instantiation.

## Usage

To use the `ServiceLocator`, you first need to register your services. Then, you can retrieve them by their registered type.

```dart
// Example of registering a service (assuming a hypothetical 'ApiService')
// ServiceLocator.instance.registerSingleton<ApiService>(ApiService());

// Example of retrieving a service
// final apiService = ServiceLocator.instance.get<ApiService>();
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility considerations for the `ServiceLocator` itself are minimal as it is a backend utility. However, the services it provides may have accessibility implications that should be addressed in their respective documentation.

## Styling and Theming

The `ServiceLocator` does not directly handle UI styling or theming. These concerns are managed by the UI components that consume the services provided by the locator.

## Performance Considerations

The `ServiceLocator` is designed for efficient retrieval of registered services. Repeated calls to `get()` for the same service type will return the same instance if it was registered as a singleton, minimizing overhead.
