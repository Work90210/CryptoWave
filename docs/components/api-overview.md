## API Overview

The CryptoWave application leverages the CoinGecko API to provide real-time cryptocurrency market data, including prices, trends, and detailed coin information. The application's core functionality relies on fetching and processing data from the CoinGecko API.

### Authentication

This API does not require authentication. All data is publicly accessible through the CoinGecko API.

### Endpoint/Function Reference

The primary interaction with external data is managed through repositories that abstract API calls. The `lib/repositories` directory contains specific repository classes for different data fetching needs.
