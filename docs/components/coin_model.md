# Coin Model

The `CoinModel` represents a single cryptocurrency within the CryptoWave application. It encapsulates the data associated with a cryptocurrency, such as its ID, symbol, name, image URL, current price, and market data.

## Purpose

Use `CoinModel` to structure and manage the data for individual cryptocurrencies displayed throughout the application. This model serves as a data transfer object for cryptocurrency information fetched from external APIs.

## Props/Parameters

The `CoinModel` class has the following properties:

*   `id`: A unique identifier for the cryptocurrency (String).
*   `symbol`: The trading symbol of the cryptocurrency (String).
*   `name`: The full name of the cryptocurrency (String).
*   `image`: The URL of the cryptocurrency's image (String).
*   `currentPrice`: The current trading price of the cryptocurrency (double).
*   `marketCap`: The market capitalization of the cryptocurrency (double).
*   `priceChangePercentage24h`: The percentage change in price over the last 24 hours (double).

## Usage Examples

```dart
// Example of creating a CoinModel instance
final coinData = {
  'id': 'bitcoin',
  'symbol': 'btc',
  'name': 'Bitcoin',
  'image': 'https://example.com/bitcoin.png',
  'current_price': 50000.0,
  'market_cap': 950000000000.0,
  'price_change_percentage_24h': 2.5,
};

final bitcoin = CoinModel.fromJson(coinData);

print('Coin Name: ${bitcoin.name}');
print('Current Price: ${bitcoin.currentPrice}');
```

## Accessibility Notes

Ensure that any UI elements displaying `CoinModel` data are accessible. This includes providing appropriate text alternatives for images and ensuring sufficient color contrast for text.

## Styling/Theming Guidance

The styling of `CoinModel` data presentation is handled by the UI components that consume this model. Refer to the styling guidelines for those specific components.

## Performance Considerations

When handling lists of `CoinModel` objects, consider efficient rendering techniques such as lazy loading or virtualization to maintain smooth performance, especially with large datasets.
