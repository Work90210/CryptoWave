# Base Repository

The `BaseRepository` class serves as a foundational element for data fetching operations within the CryptoWave application. It is designed to abstract API calls and manage the interaction with external data sources, primarily the CoinGecko API.

## Purpose and Usage

The `BaseRepository` is used to encapsulate the logic for making API requests. It provides a common structure for repositories that interact with external services, ensuring consistency in how data is fetched and errors are handled. This class is intended to be extended by specific repository implementations, such as `CoinRepository`, to handle distinct data domains.

## Props/Parameters

The `BaseRepository` class does not expose any public props or parameters directly. Its functionality is invoked through its methods.

## Usage Examples

The `BaseRepository` is intended to be extended. A typical usage pattern involves creating a new repository that inherits from `BaseRepository` and implements specific data fetching methods.

```dart
// Example of extending BaseRepository (hypothetical)
import 'package:crypto_wave/repositories/base_repository.dart';

class CoinRepository extends BaseRepository {
  // Implement methods to fetch coin data from CoinGecko API
  Future<List<Coin>> fetchCoins() async {
    // Example: Call a method from BaseRepository to make an API request
    // final response = await makeGetRequest('/coins/markets');
    // Process response and return List<Coin>
    throw UnimplementedError();
  }
}
```

## Accessibility Notes (a11y)

Accessibility considerations are not directly managed by the `BaseRepository` class itself. Accessibility is handled at the UI layer, ensuring that data presented to the user is perceivable, operable, and understandable, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## Styling/Theming Guidance

Styling and theming are not within the scope of the `BaseRepository`. These aspects are managed by the UI components that consume the data provided by repositories.

## Performance Considerations

The `BaseRepository` plays a role in performance by abstracting network requests. Efficient implementation of API calls within subclasses of `BaseRepository` is crucial for application responsiveness. Considerations include:

*   Minimizing the number of API calls.
*   Handling API responses efficiently.
*   Implementing caching strategies where appropriate.
