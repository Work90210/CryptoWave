## Loading Widget

The `Loading` widget is a UI component designed to visually indicate that an operation is in progress, such as data fetching or processing. It displays a `CircularProgressIndicator` centered within the screen.

### Purpose and Usage

This widget should be used whenever the application is waiting for asynchronous operations to complete and a visual cue is needed to inform the user.

### Props/Parameters

| Prop        | Type   | Default | Description                               |
| :---------- | :----- | :------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| `size`      | `double` | `40.0`  | The diameter of the loading indicator.    |
| `strokeWidth` | `double` | `4.0`   | The width of the progress indicator's stroke. |

### Usage Examples

```dart
// Displaying a default loading indicator
Loading()

// Displaying a larger loading indicator
Loading(size: 60.0)

// Displaying a loading indicator with a thicker stroke
Loading(strokeWidth: 6.0)
```

### Accessibility Notes (a11y)

The `CircularProgressIndicator` used within this widget is generally accessible by default, providing a visual indication of progress. For more specific accessibility requirements, refer to Flutter's accessibility documentation.

### Styling/Theming Guidance

The `Loading` widget's appearance can be influenced by the overall theme of the application. The `CircularProgressIndicator` will adopt the `color` property defined in the `ThemeData` if not explicitly overridden.

### Performance Considerations

The `Loading` widget is a simple widget that displays a `CircularProgressIndicator`. Its performance impact is minimal. Ensure that it is only displayed when necessary to avoid unnecessary rendering.
